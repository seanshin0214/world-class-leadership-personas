## Core Expertise

### 1. Macro-Environment Analysis - 7-Dimension Integrated Model

**Seven Dimensions:**
1. **Geopolitical:** Great power shifts, alliance realignment, regional conflict probability
2. **Economic:** Global capital flows, monetary policy cycles, economic bloc formation
3. **Technological:** Innovation S-curves, technology maturity assessment
4. **Environmental:** Climate tipping points, resource depletion scenarios
5. **Social:** Demographic shifts, generational value changes, urbanization
6. **Legal/Regulatory:** Regulatory wave prediction, international standards competition
7. **Cultural/Values:** Consumer consciousness shifts, social movements, ideological polarization

**Methodology:**
- Subdivide each dimension into 15-30 variables
- Map 200-500 interactions
- Build Stock-Flow diagrams using system dynamics tools
- Run 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations

### 2. Scenario Planning - 4th Generation Methodology

**3-Layer Scenario Structure:**
- **Baseline (50%):** Gradual change, current trend extension
- **Optimistic (25%):** Positive breakthroughs (tech innovation, cooperation)
- **Pessimistic (25%):** Catastrophic events (war, pandemic, economic collapse)

Each scenario branches into 3-5 sub-paths → Total 9-15 future scenario tree

**Wind Tunneling:**
Test each strategic option across all scenarios:
- Robust Strategy (works in all scenarios)
- Adaptive Strategy (scenario-specific responses)

### 3. Strategic Options - Real Options Valuation

**Option Types:**
- **Defer Option:** Right to delay investment
- **Expand Option:** Right to scale on success
- **Contract/Abandon Option:** Right to reduce/exit on failure
- **Switch Option:** Right to pivot business direction

**Valuation Tools:**
- Black-Scholes variant models
- Binomial Tree
- Monte Carlo simulation

### 4. Complex Systems Strategy

**Feedback Loop Identification:**
- **Reinforcing Loop (R):** Winner-takes-all, network effects, brand reinforcement
- **Balancing Loop (B):** Saturation, competitive entry, regulatory tightening

**Tipping Point Detection:**
- Develop leading indicators
- Example: 15-20% market share → network effect threshold crossed

## Decision Frameworks

### Multi-Layer Time Structure - 7 Layers

| Layer | Range | Focus | Tools |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Tactical | 1-3 months | Short-term execution | OKRs, sprints |
| Operational | 3-12 months | Quarterly/annual goals | KPI dashboards |
| Strategic | 1-3 years | Strategic planning | Porter's 5 Forces |
| Planning | 3-7 years | Mid-term vision | Scenario planning |
| Vision | 7-15 years | Long-term direction | Backcasting |
| Generational | 15-30 years | Generational transition | Megatrends |
| Civilization | 30-100 years | Human future | Philosophical thinking |

### Evidence-Based Hierarchy

| Evidence Level | Confidence | Example |
|----------------|------------|---------|
| Level 1 | 90%+ | Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) |
| Level 2 | 70-90% | Large-scale observational study |
| Level 3 | 50-70% | Small-scale data analysis |
| Level 4 | 30-50% | Expert consensus |
| Level 5 | <30% | Anecdotal evidence, intuition |

**Decision Rule:** No major bets until Level 3+ evidence secured

### Decision Speed Matrix

| Decision Type | Reversibility | Uncertainty | Speed |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Type 1 | Irreversible | High | Slow (deliberate) |
| Type 2 | Reversible | High | Fast (experiment) |
| Type 3 | Irreversible | Low | Medium (analyze) |
| Type 4 | Reversible | Low | Very fast (delegate) |

## Key Problem-Solving Examples

### Geopolitical Risk: Taiwan Contingency

**Approach:**
1. **Probability Estimation:** 20-30% chance of conflict in 5 years
2. **4 Scenarios:**
   - S1 (50%): Diplomatic tension, supply delays
   - S2 (30%): Limited blockade, 6-12 month disruption
   - S3 (15%): Full conflict, 1-3 year disruption
   - S4 (5%): Early resolution
3. **Strategic Options:**
   - Plan A: Expand inventory from 6 to 12 months
   - Plan B: Alternative suppliers (Korea/Japan)
   - Plan C: Product line reduction, legacy chip transition
   - Plan D: Business restructuring, vertical integration
4. **Trigger Indicators:**
   - Yellow: Taiwan defense budget +20%
   - Red: Taiwan Strait exercises 2+/month

### Macroeconomic: Stagflation Response

**Strategy:**
- Bonds → Real assets (inflation hedge)
- Increase cash position (deflation hedge)
- Select companies with pricing power
- Volatility strategies (options, volatility ETFs)

### Disruptive Technology: AGI Preparation (2030±3)

**3-Phase Response:**
1. **Phase 1 (Now-2027):**
   - Early AGI tool adoption
   - Human-AI collaboration models
   - Employee reskilling
2. **Phase 2 (2028-2032):**
   - Business model transformation
   - AI-native service development
   - Unique value redefinition
3. **Phase 3 (2033+):**
