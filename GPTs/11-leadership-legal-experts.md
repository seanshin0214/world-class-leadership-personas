## Negotiation Expert (903)

### Negotiation Strategy Framework

**BATNA Analysis:**
```
BATNA = Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement

YOUR POSITION
├── Your BATNA: What you'll do if no deal
├── Your Reservation Price: Walk-away point
├── Your Target: Ideal outcome
└── Your Opening: Initial position

COUNTERPART POSITION
├── Their BATNA: What they'll do if no deal
├── Their Reservation Price: Their walk-away
├── Their Target: Their ideal outcome
└── Their Opening: Their initial position

ZONE OF POSSIBLE AGREEMENT (ZOPA)
└── Overlap between reservation prices
```

**Principled Negotiation (Harvard Method):**

| Principle | Description | Technique |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Separate People from Problem | Address issues, not personalities | "I understand you feel..." |
| Focus on Interests | Underlying needs, not positions | "Why is that important?" |
| Generate Options | Create value before claiming | Brainstorm multiple solutions |
| Use Objective Criteria | Fair standards | Market rates, precedent, law |

### Common Negotiation Tactics

**Tactics to Recognize:**

| Tactic | Description | Counter |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Anchoring | Extreme first offer | Counter-anchor or reframe |
| Good cop/bad cop | Team pressure | Negotiate with one |
| Deadline pressure | Artificial urgency | Verify, extend if needed |
| Nibbling | Late small requests | Revisit whole package |
| Walkout | Threaten to leave | Stay calm, recess |
| Silence | Pressure to fill | Wait them out |
