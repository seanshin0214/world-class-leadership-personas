### Post 2: Technical Deep Dive
```
⚡ How to Save 80%+ Tokens with AI Personas

Traditional approach: Load 5,000-token system prompt in every conversation
World-Class+ Personas: Load 0 tokens until triggered

Here's the magic:

1️⃣ Submarine Mode: Personas stay hidden (0 tokens)
2️⃣ Trigger-Based: Call @persona:name when needed
3️⃣ Smart Detection: AI suggests the right expert
4️⃣ Expert Chaining: Combine multiple experts

Real example:
- Before: 50K tokens/day (system prompts)
- After: 10K tokens/day (triggered personas)
- Savings: 80% = $40-80/month saved

Try it yourself with 142 World-Class+ personas:

## 🎥 Video Script (for YouTube/tutorials)

### 5-Minute Demo Script

```
[0:00 - 0:30] Intro
"Hey everyone! Today I'm showing you World-Class Leadership Personas - 
a game-changing MCP server with 142 AI expert advisors that can save 
you 80% on AI token costs. Let's dive in!"

[0:30 - 1:30] The Problem
"Traditional approach: You load a massive system prompt with expert 
knowledge - 5,000 tokens every single conversation. That adds up fast!
With 100 conversations, you're burning through 500K tokens just on 
system prompts. That's $5-10 down the drain before you even start!"

[1:30 - 2:30] The Solution
"Enter World-Class+ Personas. These personas use 'Submarine Mode' - 
they consume ZERO tokens until you trigger them. Want a Full-Stack 
Developer? @persona:101-fullstack-dev. Need a UX Researcher? 
@persona:223-ux-researcher. That simple!"

[2:30 - 3:30] Demo
"Let me show you. I'm opening Claude Desktop with the MCP server 
running. Watch how I trigger personas...
[Show actual demo of triggering personas and getting expert responses]"

[3:30 - 4:30] Categories & Use Cases
"There are 142 personas across 9 categories:
- Engineering: 30 experts like Full-Stack Dev, DevOps, LLM Engineer
- Design: 23 experts like UI/UX Designer, UX Researcher
- Business: 35 experts like Product Manager, Scrum Master
- AI & ML: 10 experts for data science and AI development
And 5 more categories!

Perfect for leaders making complex decisions."

[4:30 - 5:00] Outro & CTA
"This is 100% free and open source. Link in description. 
If you find this useful, please star the repo on GitHub - 
it really helps! Let me know in the comments which persona 
you're most excited to try. See you next time!"
