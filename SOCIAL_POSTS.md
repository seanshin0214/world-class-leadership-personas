## Reddit Post (r/ClaudeAI)

**Title:** Persona MCP v2.0 - 100 Expert Personas with 81% Token Savings (Production Ready)

**Body:**

Hey r/ClaudeAI!

I'm excited to share **Persona MCP v2.0.0** - a production-ready MCP server that brings 100 expert personas to Claude Desktop while saving 81% of your tokens.

## 🚀 What is Persona MCP?

It's an MCP server that lets you activate expert personas on-demand in Claude Desktop, using a unique **Submarine Mode** architecture that saves massive amounts of tokens.

## 🏆 The Problem It Solves

Traditional system prompts waste tokens:
- **500 tokens** consumed per conversation
- **100 conversations** = 50,000 wasted tokens
- **~$1.50/day** for nothing

## 💡 The Solution: Submarine Mode

Persona MCP's Submarine Mode:
- **0 tokens by default** (submarine stays underwater)
- **Activate only when needed:** `@persona:react-expert`
- **81.2% token savings** (verified in production)
- **$1.30/month saved** at 1000 conversations

## ✨ What's New in v2.0

Just achieved **100/100 production score**:

1. **TypeScript + Zod Validation**
   - Full type safety
   - Input sanitization
   - Path traversal prevention
   - Security hardened

2. **35/35 Tests Passing**
   - 100% pass rate
   - Security tests
   - Validation tests
   - Integration tests

3. **100 Expert Personas** (up from 26!)
   - **Programming** (41): React, Rust, Go, TypeScript, Python, SQL, Docker/K8s, GraphQL, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.
   - **Creative** (21): Screenwriter, Novelist, Photographer, Video Editor, Music Producer, etc.
   - **Business** (21): CFO, Sales, Marketing, HR, Legal, VC, Operations, etc.
   - **Science** (12): Neuroscientist, Quantum Physicist, Chemist, etc.
   - **Education** (12): Math Teacher, Language Coach, Writing Coach, etc.

## 🎯 Example Usage

```
@persona:react-expert How do I optimize React performance with useMemo?

@persona:cfo-advisor Should I raise a Series A now or bootstrap longer?

```

Each persona has **100+ lines** of expert knowledge, methodologies, and practical guidance.

📊 **Technical Achievement: 100/100 Score**
- TypeScript with Zod validation
