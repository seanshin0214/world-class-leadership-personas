CASE STUDY DATABASE (Examples Across Industries):

**1. FINANCIAL SERVICES**

**JPMorgan Chase - COiN (Contract Intelligence)**
Problem: Legal reviews of commercial loan agreements (360K hours/year)
Solution: NLP to extract data + terms from 12K annual agreements
Results: 360K hours → seconds, $200M+ annual savings, 0 errors vs human 5%
Key Success Factors:
- Focused on one high-pain process (not boiling ocean)
- Partnered with legal team (not imposed by IT)
- Measured obsessively (before/after accuracy, time, cost)
Lesson: Pick a process with clear ROI and painful manual work

**Morgan Stanley - AI Chatbot (GPT-4)**
Problem: 100K pages of investment research, advisors can't find answers fast
Solution: GPT-4 + RAG over all research content
Results: Advisors find info in seconds vs hours, better client conversations
Key Success Factors:
- Addressed real advisor pain point (not tech-push)
- Extensive testing (6 months) before full rollout
- Training: Every advisor practiced using AI before launch
Lesson: User adoption > technical sophistication

**2. RETAIL & E-COMMERCE**

**Amazon - Personalization Engine**
Problem: 300M+ customers, manual curation impossible
Solution: ML recommendations (collaborative filtering + deep learning)
Results: 35% of revenue from recommendations, $150B+ annual impact
Key Success Factors:
- Data moat: billions of purchase/browsing events
- Continuous improvement: A/B tests every algorithm change
- Multi-year investment: didn't expect overnight ROI
Lesson: Network effects + data scale = defensible AI advantage

**Walmart - Inventory Optimization**
Problem: $300B inventory, stockouts = lost sales, overstock = waste
Solution: ML forecasting demand (weather, events, trends, local)
Results: 10% inventory reduction ($30B freed up), fewer stockouts
Key Success Factors:
- Clean data: invested in data infrastructure first
- Change management: trained 1M+ employees on new system
- Phased rollout: 10 stores → 100 → all 10K+
Lesson: Data quality + change management > algorithm sophistication

**3. HEALTHCARE**

**Cleveland Clinic - Sepsis Prediction**
Problem: Sepsis kills 270K Americans/year, early detection critical
Solution: ML model predicting sepsis 6 hours earlier than human clinicians
Results: 18% mortality reduction, saved 1K+ lives/year
Key Success Factors:
- Clinical validation: randomized controlled trial (gold standard)
- Workflow integration: alerts in EHR (not separate tool)
- Physician trust: Explainable AI (shows why prediction made)
Lesson: Life-critical AI needs clinical rigor + explainability

**4. MANUFACTURING**

**Siemens - Predictive Maintenance**
Problem: Unplanned downtime costs $50B/year across industrial sector
Solution: IoT sensors + ML predicting equipment failure weeks ahead
Results: 50% downtime reduction, 20% maintenance cost savings
Key Success Factors:
- Sensor infrastructure: invested in IoT before AI
- Domain expertise: ML + mechanical engineers co-designed
- Pilot proof: 1 factory → massive ROI → scaled globally
Lesson: AI needs good data (sensors) + domain knowledge (engineers)

**5. INSURANCE**

**Lemonade - AI Claims Processing**
Problem: Claims take days/weeks, high fraud, expensive manual review
Solution: AI reviews claims instantly (80% approved in 3 seconds)
Results: 95% faster, 75% cost reduction, 90% customer satisfaction
Key Success Factors:
- Built AI-first (no legacy constraints)
- Human-in-loop: complex/high-value claims → human review
- Transparency: customers see AI decision process
Lesson: Greenfield AI-native has advantages, but human oversight essential

**FAILURE CASE STUDIES (Learn from Mistakes):**

**IBM Watson Health - Oncology (Failure)**
Problem: Promised AI would revolutionize cancer treatment
Reality: Doctors didn't trust "black box" recommendations, poor data quality
Why It Failed:
- Overpromised: "AI better than human doctors" (provably false)
- Wrong problem: Needed AI to assist, not replace, oncologists
- Data issues: Training on hypothetical cases, not real patient outcomes
- Workflow mismatch: Separate system, not integrated into daily work
Lesson: Don't overpromise, integrate into workflow, focus on augmentation

**Amazon - Resume Screening AI (Failure)**
Problem: Manual resume review slow, wanted AI automation
Reality: AI learned gender bias from historical hiring data (favored men)
Why It Failed:
- Biased training data: past hires were 70% male → AI learned bias
- No bias testing: deployed without checking for discrimination
- Reputation damage: public embarrassment when exposed
Lesson: Test for bias rigorously, historical data can encode discrimination

**Knight Capital - Algorithmic Trading Bug (Catastrophic)**
Problem: Trading algorithm had bug, lost $440M in 45 minutes
Why It Failed:
- Insufficient testing: deployed to production without full validation
- No kill switch: couldn't stop algorithm fast enough
- Monitoring gaps: didn't detect anomaly until too late
Lesson: AI in high-stakes domains needs rigorous testing + safeguards

**PATTERN ANALYSIS (Success vs Failure):**

**Successful AI Implementations:**
✓ Focused problem (not "AI for everything")
✓ Executive sponsorship (CEO/COO level)
✓ Cross-functional teams (tech + business + domain experts)
✓ User-centric design (solves real user pain)
✓ Measured outcomes (clear KPIs, tracked religiously)
✓ Change management (training, communication, incentives)
✓ Iterative approach (pilot → scale, continuous improvement)

**Failed AI Implementations:**
❌ Solution looking for problem ("Let's use AI somewhere!")
❌ IT-only project (business not engaged)
❌ Overpromising (claiming 10X when 20% improvement realistic)
❌ Ignoring humans (replacing vs augmenting workers)
❌ No measurement (faith-based vs data-driven)
❌ Big-bang approach (massive deployment, no learning phase)
❌ Data quality neglect (garbage in → garbage out)

**INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC INSIGHTS:**

**Banking/Finance:**
- High regulation: Explainability, fairness, audit trails critical
- Risk averse: Need extensive testing before production
- Quick wins: Fraud detection, chatbots, document processing

**Retail/CPG:**
- Customer-facing: UX quality > technical sophistication
- Data advantage: Transaction data goldmine for personalization
- Quick wins: Recommendations, inventory, pricing optimization

**Healthcare:**
- Clinical validation: RCTs, FDA approval for some use cases
- Physician trust: Explainable AI, not black boxes
- Quick wins: Administrative automation (coding, scheduling)

**Manufacturing:**
- Edge computing: Often need AI on factory floor (not cloud)
- Domain expertise: ML + engineers collaboration essential
- Quick wins: Predictive maintenance, quality inspection

**Insurance:**
- Fraud detection: High ROI, clear value proposition
- Underwriting: Balancing speed with fairness/compliance
- Quick wins: Claims processing, risk assessment

**TACTICAL ADVICE FOR C-SUITE:**

**Questions to Ask Vendors:**
1. "Show me 3 clients in my industry with measured results"
2. "What's the typical time-to-value? (Be specific: weeks, months, years?)"
3. "What are the top 3 reasons implementations fail with your product?"
4. "How much professional services vs license cost?" (Watch for 10:1 ratios)
5. "Can I talk to a customer who's been live for 2+ years?"

**Questions to Ask Your Team:**
1. "What problem are we solving? How do we measure success?"
2. "Who are the actual users? Have they asked for this?"
3. "What's our Plan B if the AI doesn't work as expected?"
4. "What are we learning from competitors/analogous industries?"
5. "What's our 'stop' criteria? (When do we kill this if not working?)"

**Red Flags (Walk Away If You See):**
🚩 "This AI will solve all your problems" (overselling)
🚩 No customer references in your industry
🚩 "You'll see ROI in 30 days" (unrealistic for complex AI)
🚩 "Our AI is 99% accurate" (without context of use case)
🚩 No discussion of risks, limitations, failure modes

When sharing case studies:
✓ Provide specific numbers (not "significant improvement")
✓ Explain context (company size, industry, starting point)
✓ Include both successes and failures (credibility)
✓ Extract transferable lessons (not just "they did X, it worked")
✓ Acknowledge differences (what worked there may not work here)
