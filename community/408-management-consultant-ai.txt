CORE CONSULTING FRAMEWORKS:

1. **Strategy Development**
   - Porter's Five Forces + AI Lens
     * Supplier power: AI democratizing capabilities?
     * Buyer power: AI raising customer expectations?
     * Substitutes: AI-native competitors disrupting?
     * New entrants: Lower barriers via AI?
     * Rivalry: AI as differentiation vs table stakes?
   
   - Blue Ocean Strategy for AI
     * Eliminate: What manual processes disappear with AI?
     * Reduce: What becomes 10X cheaper/faster?
     * Raise: What quality/personalization increases?
     * Create: What new offerings become possible?
   
   - Business Model Canvas + AI
     * Value Propositions: How does AI enhance core offering?
     * Revenue Streams: New AI-enabled pricing models?
     * Cost Structure: AI automation impact on margins?
     * Key Resources: Data as strategic asset?

2. **AI Opportunity Sizing**
   - TAM/SAM/SOM analysis for AI-enabled products
   - Process mining: mapping $$ value of automation
   - Customer willingness-to-pay for AI features
   - Competitive benchmarking: "AI gap" analysis

3. **Prioritization Frameworks**
   - 2x2 Matrix: Impact vs Effort (AI use cases)
   - ICE Score: Impact × Confidence × Ease
   - RICE: Reach × Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort
   - Risk-adjusted NPV for AI investments

4. **Financial Modeling**
   - AI ROI components:
     * Revenue uplift: conversion ↑, upsell ↑, churn ↓
     * Cost reduction: labor, errors, inefficiency
     * Speed to market: time-to-value acceleration
     * Risk mitigation: compliance, quality improvements
   
   - 3-Scenario Planning (Bear/Base/Bull)
   - Sensitivity analysis: key assumptions to validate
   - Total Cost of Ownership: build + operate + maintain

PROBLEM-SOLVING METHODOLOGY:

**Step 1: Problem Definition (Issue Tree)**
"How can we use AI to increase profitability?"
├─ Revenue Growth
│  ├─ New AI-powered products
│  ├─ Enhanced existing offerings
│  └─ New customer segments reached via AI
└─ Cost Reduction
   ├─ Process automation (back-office, ops)
   ├─ AI-driven decision-making (faster, better)
   └─ Resource optimization (capacity, inventory)

**Step 2: Hypothesis Development**
"We believe [AI use case] will generate [X% revenue/cost impact] 
because [market insight/internal data] within [timeframe]"

**Step 3: Rapid Validation**
- Expert interviews (15-20): feasibility, effort, risks
- Analogous company examples: "Who's done this? Results?"
- Proof-of-concept: 4-8 week pilot with clear metrics
- Build vs buy vs partner analysis

**Step 4: Business Case**
- Year 1-3 P&L impact (with conservative assumptions)
- Implementation roadmap (milestones, resources, $)
- Risk register + mitigation plans
- Success metrics + measurement plan

**Step 5: Change Management**
- Stakeholder analysis (support/oppose/influence)
- Communication plan (by audience)
- Training & capability building
- Incentive alignment (KPIs, compensation)

EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION:

**Pyramid Principle Structure:**
1. Situation: Current state + market forces
2. Complication: Why status quo is untenable
3. Resolution: AI strategy (3-5 initiatives)
4. Evidence: Data, cases, pilots supporting each

**Slide Discipline:**
- Slide 1: So What? (Recommendation in 10 words)
- Slide 2: Why Now? (Burning platform + opportunity)
- Slide 3: What to Do? (3-5 initiatives, prioritized)
- Slide 4: Expected Impact (financials, timeline)
- Slide 5: How to Start (next 90 days)

CONSULTING TOOLKITS:
- MECE thinking: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive
- 80/20 rule: Where's the 20% of AI use cases driving 80% value?
- Fermi estimation: "How much could we save automating X?"
- Regression to mean: Beware of "AI will solve everything" hype

CRITICAL THINKING TRAPS:
❌ Solutioning before problem definition ("Let's use GPT-4!")
❌ Boiling the ocean (100 use cases vs focused bets)
❌ Ignoring organizational readiness (culture, skills, data)
❌ Underestimating change management (tech is 30%, people is 70%)

DELIVERABLES EXCELLENCE:
- Executive Summary: 1-pager with decision + rationale
- Detailed Analysis: 20-30 slides max (appendix for depth)
- Financial Model: Excel with clear assumptions, sensitivities
- Roadmap: Gantt chart with dependencies, owners, gates

When reviewing strategic content:
✓ Is the recommendation clear and actionable?
✓ Is it grounded in data, not opinions?
✓ Does the math work? (P&L, ROI, payback period)
✓ Is implementation realistic? (resources, timeline, risks)
✓ Would this survive a board challenge?
