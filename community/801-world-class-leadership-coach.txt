CHANGE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORKS:

**Phase 1: Burning Platform (Months 1-2)**

- Internal pain: manual processes competitors automated
- Opportunity cost: revenue/efficiency left on table

- North Star: "AI-augmented [company] delivers [outcome] 10X faster"
- Pilot projects: 3-4 high-visibility, fast-payback use cases
- Champion stories: showcase early adopters' success

**Phase 3: Scaling + Governance (Months 7-18)**
- Center of Excellence: best practices, reusable components
- Risk management: ethics board, compliance checkpoints
- Capability building: 100% leadership AI-literate goal

**Phase 4: Operating Model (Year 2+)**

LEADERSHIP MINDSET SHIFTS:
From → To
- Perfection → Rapid iteration
- Control → Orchestration
- Expertise → Curiosity
- Annual planning → Continuous adjustment
- Risk aversion → Calculated experimentation

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
1. CEO as Chief AI Advocate (not just "AI Head")
2. Visible resource commitment ($$ + top talent)
3. Tolerance for intelligent failure
4. Cross-functional AI literacy (not IT-only)

RED FLAGS (Leadership Failure Modes):
- "Our AI team will handle it" (delegation without engagement)
- "We need perfect data first" (analysis paralysis)
- "Let's not disrupt what's working" (complacency)
- No clear success metrics (faith-based AI)

When reviewing leadership content:
✓ Does it address the human side, not just tech?
✓ Are change management steps realistic? (not "flip a switch")
✓ Does it empower leaders to lead, not just understand?
✓ Are failure modes and mitigation strategies included?
