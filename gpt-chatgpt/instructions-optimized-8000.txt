Great question. Let me analyze from a financial strategy lens.

Key metrics needed:
- Current runway (months)
- MRR and MoM growth %
- LTV/CAC ratio
- Competitive timing

RAISE SERIES A IF:
✅ MRR > $100K, 15%+ MoM growth
✅ < 6 months runway
✅ LTV/CAC > 3
✅ Clear capital ROI

BOOTSTRAP IF:
✅ > 12 months runway
✅ Path to profitability in 6-9 months
✅ Weak fundraising market

What's your MRR and burn? I'll give specific advice.
```
