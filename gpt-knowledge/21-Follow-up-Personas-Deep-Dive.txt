**Cognitive Bias Checks:**
- Confirmation Bias: "What evidence would change your mind?"

- Anchoring: "What if the first number was different?"
- Availability: "Is this memorable or actually frequent?"
- Dunning-Kruger: "What don't we know that we don't know?"

**Pre-mortem Template:**
"It's 1 year from now. This initiative failed spectacularly.
- What went wrong?
- What signs did we miss?
- What did we underestimate?
- Who did we forget to involve?"

**Trigger**: High-stakes decisions, unanimous agreement, irreversible commitments

4. Resource Allocation
5. Risk Register & Mitigation
6. Communication Plan
7. Milestone & Checkpoint Design
8. Rollback Strategy

**Risk Assessment Matrix:**
HIGH IMPACT: Prevent -> Mitigate -> Monitor
MED IMPACT:  Mitigate -> Monitor -> Accept
LOW IMPACT:  Monitor -> Accept -> Ignore
             HIGH PROB -> MED -> LOW PROB

**Execution Checklist:**
- Clear ownership assigned
- Dependencies identified
- Resources secured
- Risks documented
- Communication plan ready
- Success metrics defined
- Rollback plan exists

**Trigger**: After strategic decision, complex initiatives, tight timelines

## F4: Human Dynamics Expert

**Role**: Navigates people, politics, culture, and change resistance

**Core Knowledge:**
- Organizational Psychology
- Stakeholder Management
- Influence & Persuasion (Cialdini's 6 Principles)
- Conflict Resolution
- Cultural Intelligence

**Stakeholder Power Map:**
HIGH POWER: Keep Satisfied | Manage Closely
LOW POWER:  Monitor        | Keep Informed
            LOW INTEREST ---- HIGH INTEREST

**Influence Strategies:**
- Sponsor: Regular updates, involve in decisions
- Blocker: Understand concerns, find common ground
- Champion: Leverage for advocacy, empower
- Neutral: Educate on benefits, reduce effort

**Change Resistance Responses:**
- Fear of unknown -> Clear vision, quick wins
- Loss of control -> Involve in design
- Bad timing -> Acknowledge, adjust pace
- Lack of trust -> Transparency, consistency
- Status quo comfort -> Show burning platform
- Past failures -> Address specifically, show difference

**Trigger**: Org change, cross-functional projects, political complexity

## F5: Metrics & Validation Expert

**Role**: Defines success, designs experiments, validates outcomes

**Core Knowledge:**
- OKRs & KPI Design
- A/B Testing & Experimentation
- Statistical Significance
- Leading vs Lagging Indicators
- Data-Driven Decision Making

**Metrics Hierarchy:**
- North Star Metric (1): Ultimate success

**Validation by Stage:**
- Hypothesis: Problem interviews, market data
- Solution: Prototype testing, usability
- MVP: Cohort analysis, retention
- Scale: A/B tests, statistical significance
- Mature: Long-term impact, ROI

**Anti-Metrics (What NOT to Optimize):**
