### Learning Science Principles

**Bloom's Taxonomy (Revised)**
```
CREATE (Highest)
├── Design, construct, produce, invent
├── "Design a solution to..."

EVALUATE
├── Judge, critique, assess, justify
├── "Which approach is better and why?"

ANALYZE
├── Compare, contrast, organize, differentiate
├── "What are the key differences between..."

APPLY
├── Use, implement, solve, demonstrate
├── "Solve this problem using..."

UNDERSTAND
├── Explain, summarize, interpret, classify
├── "Explain in your own words..."

REMEMBER (Foundation)
├── Recall, list, define, identify
├── "What is the definition of..."
```

**Active Learning Strategies**
```
1. RETRIEVAL PRACTICE
   - Self-testing without notes
   - Flashcards (spaced repetition)
   - Practice problems
   - Teaching others

2. SPACED REPETITION
   Day 1: Learn new material
   Day 2: Review
   Day 4: Review
   Day 7: Review
   Day 14: Review
   Day 30: Review

3. INTERLEAVING
   Instead of: AAA BBB CCC
   Practice:   ABC BCA CAB
   Mix different types of problems

4. ELABORATION
   - Connect to existing knowledge
   - Generate examples
   - Ask "why" and "how"
   - Create analogies

5. DUAL CODING
   - Combine words with visuals
   - Diagrams, charts, mind maps
   - Sketch while learning
```

## Test Prep Tutor (614)

### Standardized Test Strategies

**SAT/ACT Reading**
```
PASSAGE APPROACH:
1. Skim passage (2-3 min)
   - First/last sentences of paragraphs
   - Transition words
   - Main argument

2. Read questions first (30 sec)
   - Mark line references
   - Note question types

3. Answer with evidence
   - Find specific text support
   - Eliminate wrong answers

QUESTION TYPES:
- Main Idea: Look at intro/conclusion
- Detail: Go to line reference
- Inference: Find closest supported answer
- Vocabulary: Use context clues
- Author's Purpose: Consider tone and argument
```

**SAT/ACT Math**
```
STRATEGY:
1. Easy → Medium → Hard
2. Skip and return (don't get stuck)
3. Show all work
4. Check by plugging in

COMMON PATTERNS:
- Percent problems: Part/Whole × 100
- Rate problems: Distance = Rate × Time
- Algebra: Isolate variable step by step
- Geometry: Draw and label diagrams
- Statistics: Mean, Median, Mode formulas

CALCULATOR TIPS:
- Store formulas in programs
- Use table feature for functions
- Graph to visualize
```

**Essay Writing Formula**
```
INTRODUCTION (3-4 sentences)
├── Hook (engaging opener)
├── Context (background)
├── Thesis (clear argument + 3 reasons)

BODY PARAGRAPH 1 (6-8 sentences)
├── Topic sentence (reason 1)
├── Evidence (quote/example)
├── Analysis (explain significance)
├── Transition

BODY PARAGRAPH 2 (6-8 sentences)
├── Topic sentence (reason 2)
├── Evidence
├── Analysis
├── Transition

BODY PARAGRAPH 3 (6-8 sentences)
├── Topic sentence (reason 3)
├── Evidence
├── Analysis
├── Transition to conclusion

CONCLUSION (3-4 sentences)
├── Restate thesis (different words)
├── Summarize main points

```

### Math Teaching Strategies

**Problem-Solving Framework**
```
UNDERSTAND
- What is the question asking?
- What information is given?
- What is unknown?
- Draw a diagram

PLAN
- What strategy will you use?
- Have you seen similar problems?
- Can you simplify?

SOLVE
- Execute your plan
- Show all steps
- Check units
- Verify calculations

REFLECT
- Does the answer make sense?
- Can you solve it differently?
- What did you learn?
```

**Common Math Misconceptions**
```
FRACTIONS
Misconception: 1/3 + 1/4 = 2/7
Correct: 1/3 + 1/4 = 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

NEGATIVE NUMBERS
Misconception: -3 - (-5) = -8
Correct: -3 - (-5) = -3 + 5 = 2

EXPONENTS
Misconception: 2³ × 2² = 2⁶
Correct: 2³ × 2² = 2⁵ = 32

ALGEBRA
Misconception: (a + b)² = a² + b²
Correct: (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²

PERCENTAGES
Misconception: 50% increase then 50% decrease = original
Correct: 100 → 150 → 75 (25% net decrease)

PEMDAS = Order of Operations

ACROSTICS
"My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nachos"
= Planet order

METHOD OF LOCI (Memory Palace)
1. Choose familiar location
2. Place items along a path
3. Visualize vividly
4. Walk through to recall

CHUNKING
Phone: 8005551234 → 800-555-1234
Credit card: 1234567890123456 → 1234 5678 9012 3456
```

**Active Recall Practice**
```
Instead of:                    Do this:
Re-reading notes         →    Close book, recall
Highlighting             →    Write questions in margins
Watching videos          →    Pause and summarize
Reviewing flashcards     →    Test yourself first
```
