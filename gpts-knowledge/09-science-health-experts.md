**Neuroplasticity Principles**
```
HEBBIAN LEARNING
"Neurons that fire together, wire together"

Mechanisms:
1. Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)
   - Strengthens frequently used connections
   - Basis of learning and memory

2. Long-Term Depression (LTD)
   - Weakens rarely used connections
   - Pruning unnecessary pathways

3. Neurogenesis
   - New neuron creation (hippocampus)
   - Enhanced by exercise, learning

4. Synaptogenesis
   - New synapse formation
   - Peaks in early development

PROMOTING NEUROPLASTICITY:
✓ Novel experiences
✓ Physical exercise
✓ Mental challenges
✓ Quality sleep
✓ Social interaction
✓ Stress management

## Data Scientist/Statistician (401/712)

### Statistical Analysis Framework

**Hypothesis Testing**
```
PROCESS:
1. State hypotheses
   H₀: Null hypothesis (no effect)
   H₁: Alternative hypothesis (effect exists)

2. Choose significance level (α)
   Typically α = 0.05

3. Select appropriate test
   (see decision tree below)

4. Calculate test statistic

5. Compare p-value to α
   p < α → Reject H₀
   p ≥ α → Fail to reject H₀

6. Draw conclusions

COMMON ERRORS:
Type I Error (False Positive): Reject H₀ when true
Type II Error (False Negative): Fail to reject H₀ when false
```

**Statistical Test Selection**
```
ONE VARIABLE:
├── Categorical → Chi-square goodness of fit
└── Continuous → One-sample t-test

TWO VARIABLES:
├── Both Categorical → Chi-square independence
├── Both Continuous → Correlation/Regression
└── One each:
    ├── 2 groups → Independent t-test
    ├── 2 groups (paired) → Paired t-test
    └── 3+ groups → ANOVA

ASSUMPTIONS CHECK:
├── Normality: Shapiro-Wilk test, Q-Q plot
├── Homogeneity: Levene's test
├── Independence: Study design
└── Sample size: n ≥ 30 for CLT

## Epidemiologist (709)

### Disease Surveillance

**Key Epidemiological Measures**
```
INCIDENCE RATE
New cases / Population at risk × Time
Example: 50 new cases / 10,000 people / year = 0.5%

PREVALENCE
Total cases / Total population
Point prevalence: At specific time
Period prevalence: Over time period

MORTALITY RATE
Deaths / Population × Time
Crude mortality: All causes
Cause-specific: Specific disease

CASE FATALITY RATE
Deaths / Confirmed cases
Measures severity (not spread)

REPRODUCTION NUMBER (R₀)
Average secondary infections from one case
R₀ > 1: Epidemic grows
R₀ < 1: Epidemic declines
R₀ = 1: Endemic equilibrium
```

**Outbreak Investigation**
```
STEPS:
1. Confirm diagnosis/outbreak
2. Define case definition
3. Count cases (epidemic curve)
4. Orient data (time, place, person)
5. Develop hypotheses
6. Test hypotheses (analytic study)
7. Implement control measures
8. Communicate findings

EPIDEMIC CURVE PATTERNS:
Point source: Sharp peak
Continuous: Plateau
Propagated: Multiple peaks
Mixed: Combination
