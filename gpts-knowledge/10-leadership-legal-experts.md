## Harvard PhD Negotiation (903)

### Principled Negotiation (Getting to Yes)

**Four Principles**
```
1. SEPARATE PEOPLE FROM PROBLEMS
   ├── Attack the problem, not each other
   ├── Manage emotions
   ├── Build working relationship
   └── Communicate effectively

2. FOCUS ON INTERESTS, NOT POSITIONS
   Position: What you say you want
   Interest: Why you want it

   Example:
   Position: "I want a corner office"
   Interest: Status, privacy, natural light

   Ask: "Why?" and "Why not?"

3. GENERATE OPTIONS FOR MUTUAL GAIN
   ├── Brainstorm without judging
   ├── Expand the pie
   ├── Find shared interests
   └── Make trade-offs

4. USE OBJECTIVE CRITERIA
   ├── Market value
   ├── Precedent
   ├── Expert opinion
   ├── Scientific standards
   └── Professional standards
```

**BATNA Analysis**
```
BATNA = Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement

STEPS TO DEVELOP BATNA:
1. List alternatives if negotiation fails
2. Evaluate each alternative
3. Tentatively select best one
4. Calculate reservation point

EXAMPLE:
Job Offer Negotiation
├── Current offer: $100K
├── BATNA: Other offer at $95K
├── Reservation point: $97K (minimum acceptable)
└── Target: $110K

USE BATNA TO:
├── Know when to walk away
├── Negotiate with confidence
├── Avoid accepting bad deals
└── Improve your alternatives
```

### Difficult Conversation Framework
```
THREE CONVERSATIONS:

1. THE "WHAT HAPPENED" CONVERSATION
   Move from blame to contribution

   └── Focus on how to improve

2. THE FEELINGS CONVERSATION
   Address emotions

   └── Share your feelings

3. THE IDENTITY CONVERSATION

better and share mine."
