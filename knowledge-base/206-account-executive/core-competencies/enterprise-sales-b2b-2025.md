OUTBOUND PROSPECTING:

EMAIL SEQUENCE:

Email 1 (Day 0):
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s [pain point]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] recently [trigger event: funding, hiring, product launch].
Congrats!

I'm reaching out because we help companies like [Similar Company] [achieve outcome] by [solution].

Worth a 15-min conversation?

Best,
[Your Name]

Email 2 (Day 3 - Value):

Hi [Name],

Following up on my previous email.

[Similar Company] reduced [metric] by 30% using our platform.

Does [Day/Time] work for a quick call?

Email 3 (Day 7 - Breakup):
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'll assume this isn't a priority right now.

If things change, feel free to reach out.

[PS: Curiosity hook or valuable resource]

→ Often gets response!

---

COLD CALLING SCRIPT:

"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. How are you?"

[Pause for response]

"Great! I know I'm calling out of the blue, so I'll be brief.

The reason I'm calling is we work with companies like [Similar Company] 
to help them [achieve outcome]. 

I'm curious - is [pain point] something on your radar?"

[Listen]

IF INTERESTED:
"Makes sense. I'd love to learn more about your situation. 
Do you have 15 minutes this week?"

IF NOT INTERESTED:
"No worries. Out of curiosity, is there a better time to reconnect, 
or is this just not a priority?"

[If truly not interested, thank them and move on]

NEVER:
❌ Argue or push back
❌ Launch into pitch immediately
✅ Ask permission to continue
✅ Be brief and respectful

---

LINKEDIN:

PROFILE OPTIMIZATION:
- Headline: "[Title] | Helping [ICP] achieve [Outcome]"
- Banner: Customer logos or value prop
- About: Problem you solve, not product features
- Featured: Case studies, testimonials

OUTREACH:
1. View profile (notification)
2. Comment on post (build awareness)

4. Message (after acceptance, value-first)

Example connection request:
"Hi [Name], saw your post on [topic]. Great insights!

Would love to connect."

DON'T:
❌ Pitch immediately after connecting
❌ Generic "I'd like to add you to my network"
```

CUSTOMIZE:
- Use their company name, logo

1. Quick recap of your goals
2. Demo of [feature A, B, C] specific to your use case
3. Q&A
4. Next steps

Please invite anyone who should be there."

---

DURING THE DEMO:

OPENING (5 min):
- Introductions (all attendees)
- Recap discovery ("You mentioned you struggle with...")
- Set expectations ("I'll show X, Y, Z. Please stop me with questions anytime")

DEMO (30 min):
- Show, don't tell (click through, not slides)

- Use their terminology (not yours)
- Pause for questions every 5-10 min
- "Does this make sense so far?"

STRUCTURE:

AVOID:
❌ Feature dump (showing everything)

```

## Proposal & Negotiation

```markdown
PROPOSAL STRUCTURE:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
- 1 page overview
- Problem statement
- Proposed solution
- ROI/value
- Investment

SITUATION:
- Current state (their pain points)
- Impact of not solving

SOLUTION:
- How your product addresses each pain point
- Key features & benefits
- Implementation plan

PRICING:
- Tiered options (Good, Better, Best)
- Breakdown: Software, implementation, support
- Annual vs monthly (show savings for annual)

Example:
| Tier | Users | Price/Year | Features |
|------|-------|------------|----------|
| Starter | 25 | $10K | Core features |
| Professional | 100 | $35K | Core + Advanced |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | $75K | All features + dedicated CSM |

CASE STUDIES:
- 2-3 similar companies
- Results (metrics)
- Testimonials

NEXT STEPS:
- Timeline
- Who does what
- Key milestones

---

NEGOTIATION TACTICS:

ANCHORING:
- Start high (they'll negotiate down)
- "Our standard price is $100K, but for [reason], I can do $85K"

BUNDLING:
- Include extras (training, premium support)
- "If you sign by end of month, I'll throw in..."

DISCOUNTING RULES:
- Never discount >20% (devalues product)
- Always tie to concession ("If you sign today...")
- Annual prepay = discount (improves cash flow)

COMMON OBJECTIONS:

"Too expensive":
- Reframe as ROI: "What's the cost of not solving this?"
- Break down per user: "$75K/year = $750/user/year = $2/day"
- Compare to alternatives: "What would it cost to build in-house?"

"Need to think about it":
- Uncover real objection: "What specifically do you need to think about?"
- Timeline: "When do you expect to make a decision?"
- Risk: "What happens if you wait?"

"Your competitor is cheaper":
- Value differentiation: "What's driving your decision - price or [value]?"
- Feature comparison: "Let's compare apples to apples..."
- Testimonials: "Here's why [Customer] chose us over them..."

---

CLOSING TECHNIQUES:

ASSUMPTIVE CLOSE:
- Act as if they've decided
- "Should we start implementation in Q1 or Q2?"
- "Will you need 50 or 100 licenses?"

ALTERNATIVE CLOSE:
- Two options (both assume sale)
- "Starter or Professional tier?"
- "Annual or monthly billing?"

URGENCY CLOSE:
- Deadline (real, not fake)
- "This pricing expires end of quarter"
- "We have limited implementation slots in Q1"

TRIAL CLOSE:
- Test readiness
- "If we can address [concern], are you ready to move forward?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you?"

DIRECT CLOSE:
- Simply ask
- "Shall we get the paperwork started?"
- "Are you ready to move forward?"
```
