## Design Principles

```markdown
CONTRAST:

PURPOSE: Create visual hierarchy, draw attention

TECHNIQUES:
- Size (large headline vs small body text)
- Color (dark text on light background)
- Weight (bold vs regular font)
- Shape (round vs angular)

EXAMPLE:
┌────────────────────────┐
│ BIG HEADLINE           │ ← High contrast (size, weight)
│ Small subtitle text    │ ← Low contrast
└────────────────────────┘

---

ALIGNMENT:

PURPOSE: Create order, cohesion

TYPES:
- Left-aligned (most readable for body text)
- Center-aligned (titles, invitations)
- Right-aligned (rare, dates, captions)
- Justified (magazines, newspapers)

RULE:
- Align elements to same edge (creates invisible line)
- Example: Left-align all text blocks

❌ BAD (random placement):
    Title
  Text here
      Button

✅ GOOD (aligned left):
Title
Text here
Button

---

REPETITION:

PURPOSE: Unity, consistency, brand recognition

EXAMPLES:
- Same font throughout
- Same color scheme
- Same button style
- Same icon style

BRAND GUIDE:
- Logo usage (size, spacing, don'ts)
- Color palette (primary, secondary, accent)
- Typography (headings, body, captions)
- Image style (photography, illustration)

---

PROXIMITY:

PURPOSE: Group related items

RULE: Related items close, unrelated items far

EXAMPLE (Business card):
┌──────────────────────┐
│ John Doe             │ ← Name/title grouped
│ Marketing Director   │
│                      │ ← Space separates groups
│ john@company.com     │ ← Contact info grouped
│ (555) 123-4567       │
└──────────────────────┘

---

WHITE SPACE (Negative Space):

PURPOSE: Breathing room, focus, elegance

BENEFITS:
- Readability (text not cramped)
- Focus (draws eye to important elements)
- Luxury feel (vs cluttered)

EXAMPLES:
- Apple website (lots of white space)
- Luxury brands (Chanel, Tiffany)

MISTAKE: Filling every pixel (amateur)
SOLUTION: Leave generous margins, padding
```

---

## Typography

```markdown
FONT CATEGORIES:

SERIF:
- Small "feet" at letter ends
- Examples: Times New Roman, Georgia, Garamond
- Use: Tradition, elegance, print (books, newspapers)
- Readability: Good for long text (print)

SANS-SERIF:
- No "feet" (clean, modern)
- Examples: Helvetica, Arial, Roboto
- Use: Modern, digital, clean
- Readability: Best for screens

SCRIPT:
- Handwriting-like
- Examples: Pacifico, Dancing Script
- Use: Invitations, logos (sparingly!)
- Readability: Low (use for short text)

DISPLAY:
- Decorative, unique
- Examples: Impact, Lobster
- Use: Headlines only (not body text)

---

FONT PAIRING:

RULE: Max 2-3 fonts per design

STRATEGY 1: Serif + Sans-Serif
- Heading: Serif (elegant)
- Body: Sans-Serif (readable)
- Example: Playfair Display (heading) + Open Sans (body)

STRATEGY 2: Same font family, different weights
- Heading: Roboto Bold
- Body: Roboto Regular
- Example: All Montserrat (Light, Regular, Bold)

AVOID:
❌ 2 serifs (too similar, compete)
❌ 2 scripts (illegible, clash)
❌ Too many fonts (chaotic)

RESOURCES:
- Google Fonts (free)
- Adobe Fonts (included with Creative Cloud)
- fontpair.co (font pairing suggestions)

---

HIERARCHY:

SIZE:
- H1 (Main title): 48px
- H2 (Section): 36px
- H3 (Subsection): 24px
- Body: 16px
- Caption: 12px

WEIGHT:
- Bold: Headlines, emphasis
- Regular: Body text
- Light: Captions, subtle text

COLOR:
- Dark: Important
- Gray: Less important

RULE: 3 levels maximum (H1, H2, Body)

---

LINE HEIGHT (Leading):

RULE: 1.5× font size (minimum)

EXAMPLE:
- Font size: 16px
- Line height: 24px (16 × 1.5)

TIGHT LEADING: <1.2× (hard to read, text cramped)
LOOSE LEADING: >2× (disconnected, hard to scan)

---

TRACKING (Letter spacing):

TIGHT: -0.02em (body text, lowercase)
NORMAL: 0 (default)
LOOSE: +0.1em (uppercase headings, small text)

EXAMPLE:
TIGHT:  ThisIsHardToRead
NORMAL: This Is Normal
LOOSE:  T H I S  I S  L O O S E
```

## Color Theory

```markdown
COLOR WHEEL:

PRIMARY:
- Red, Blue, Yellow
- Cannot be created by mixing

SECONDARY:
- Green (Blue + Yellow)
- Orange (Red + Yellow)
- Purple (Red + Blue)

TERTIARY:
- Red-Orange, Yellow-Orange, etc.

---

COLOR SCHEMES:

MONOCHROMATIC:
- One hue, different shades/tints
- Example: Light blue, medium blue, dark blue
- Safe, cohesive

ANALOGOUS:
- Colors next to each other on wheel
- Example: Blue, Blue-Green, Green
- Harmonious, natural

COMPLEMENTARY:
- Opposite on wheel
- Example: Blue & Orange, Red & Green
- High contrast, vibrant

TRIADIC:
- 3 colors, evenly spaced (triangle)
- Example: Red, Yellow, Blue
- Balanced, bold

SPLIT-COMPLEMENTARY:
- Base color + 2 adjacent to complement
- Example: Blue, Red-Orange, Yellow-Orange
- Softer than complementary

---

COLOR PSYCHOLOGY:

RED:
- Energy, passion, urgency
- Use: CTA buttons, sales
- Brands: Coca-Cola, Netflix, YouTube

BLUE:
- Trust, calm, professional
- Use: Corporate, healthcare, finance

---

60-30-10 RULE:

60%: Dominant color (background, large areas)
30%: Secondary color (supporting elements)
10%: Accent color (CTA, highlights)

EXAMPLE:
- 60% White (background)
- 30% Navy (headers, sections)
- 10% Orange (buttons, links)

---

ACCESSIBILITY (WCAG):

CONTRAST RATIO:
- Normal text (16px+): 4.5:1 minimum
- Large text (24px+): 3:1 minimum
- AAA (best): 7:1 (normal), 4.5:1 (large)

EXAMPLE:
✅ Black text (#000) on white (#FFF): 21:1 (excellent)
❌ Light gray (#AAA) on white (#FFF): 2.3:1 (fails)

TEST:
- WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Figma plugins (Stark, A11y)

COLOR BLINDNESS:
- 8% of men, 0.5% of women
- Don't rely on color alone (use icons, labels)
- Test: Coblis (Color Blindness Simulator)
