## Camera Fundamentals

```markdown
EXPOSURE TRIANGLE:

1. APERTURE (f-stop):
   - Controls depth of field (background blur)
   - Lower number = wider opening = more light = shallow DOF
   
   f/1.4 - f/2.8: Wide open
   - Use: Portraits (blurry background)
   - Shallow DOF (only subject sharp)
   
   f/8 - f/11: Medium
   - Use: General photography
   - Good sharpness, moderate DOF
   
   f/16 - f/22: Narrow
   - Use: Landscapes (everything sharp)
   - Deep DOF (foreground to background)

2. SHUTTER SPEED:
   - Controls motion blur
   
   Fast (1/1000s - 1/4000s):
   - Freeze motion (sports, wildlife)
   - Birds in flight, running athletes
   
   Medium (1/60s - 1/250s):
   - General handheld shooting
   - Rule: 1/focal length (e.g., 50mm → 1/50s minimum)
   
   Slow (1s - 30s):
   - Motion blur (waterfalls, light trails)
   - Tripod required
   - Long exposure (stars, night)

3. ISO (Sensitivity):
   - Controls brightness + noise
   
   Low (100-400):
   - Bright conditions (daylight)
   - Clean, no noise
   
   Medium (800-3200):
   - Indoor, overcast
   - Some noise (acceptable)
   
   High (6400+):
   - Low light (night, concerts)
   - Noisy (grainy)
   - Use only when needed

---

SHOOTING MODES:

MANUAL (M):
- Full control (set all 3: aperture, shutter, ISO)
- Use: Studio, consistent lighting
- Pros: Complete creative control
- Cons: Slower

APERTURE PRIORITY (A/Av):
- You set aperture, camera sets shutter
- Use: Portraits (control DOF), landscapes
- Most versatile mode

SHUTTER PRIORITY (S/Tv):
- You set shutter, camera sets aperture
- Use: Sports, action (control motion blur)

AUTO:
- Camera decides everything
- Use: Quick snapshots, learning
- Cons: No creative control

---

FOCUS:

AUTOFOCUS MODES:

AF-S (Single):
- Focus locks when half-press
- Use: Stationary subjects (portraits, landscapes)

AF-C (Continuous):
- Tracks moving subject
- Use: Sports, wildlife, kids

AF-A (Auto):
- Camera chooses S or C
- Use: General shooting

FOCUS POINTS:
- Single point: Precise (choose where to focus)
- Dynamic area: Tracks subject (sports)
- Auto area: Camera picks (convenience)

BACK-BUTTON FOCUS:
- Separate focus from shutter
- AF-ON button focuses
- Shutter button only takes photo
- Prevents accidental refocusing
```

## Lighting

```markdown
NATURAL LIGHT:

GOLDEN HOUR:
- 1 hour after sunrise, 1 hour before sunset
- Warm, soft, flattering light
- Long shadows, glowing skin tones
- Best time for portraits, landscapes

BLUE HOUR:
- 20-30 min before sunrise, after sunset
- Cool, blue tones
- Good for cityscapes (lights on, sky still visible)

MIDDAY (Harsh):
- Overhead sun, hard shadows
- Unflattering for portraits (raccoon eyes)
- Solutions:
  * Shoot in shade (open shade, soft light)
  * Use reflector (bounce light into shadows)
  * Flash (fill flash, reduce shadows)

OVERCAST (Cloudy):
- Soft, diffused light (cloud = natural softbox)
- Even lighting, no harsh shadows
- Good for portraits (flattering skin tones)

---

ARTIFICIAL LIGHT:

FLASH (Speedlight):

ON-CAMERA FLASH:
- Direct: Harsh, flat (avoid!)
- Bounce: Aim at ceiling/wall (soft, natural)
- Diffuser: Soften (small softbox for flash)

OFF-CAMERA FLASH:
- Wireless trigger (transmitter on camera, flash off-camera)
- More control (angle, distance)
- Dramatic lighting

TTL (Through The Lens):
- Camera meters, auto adjusts flash power
- Easy, works most of the time

MANUAL:
- You set flash power (1/1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc.)
- Consistent results
- Learn: Start 1/4 power, adjust

---

STUDIO LIGHTING:

3-POINT LIGHTING:

KEY LIGHT:
- Main light (brightest)
- 45° to side, slightly above
- Creates dimension (shadows on opposite side)

FILL LIGHT:
- Opposite side of key
- Lower power (1/2 to 1/4 of key)
- Fills shadows (not eliminate)

RIM LIGHT (Back light):
- Behind subject
- Separates from background
- Creates edge glow (hair light)

RATIOS:
- 2:1 (key:fill): Subtle (fashion, beauty)
- 4:1: Moderate (portraits)
- 8:1: Dramatic (low key, moody)

---

LIGHT MODIFIERS:

SOFTBOX:
- Large, soft light (mimics window)
- Flattering for portraits
- Sizes: 24"×24" (headshots), 48"×48" (full body)

UMBRELLA:
- Shoot-through: Soft, wide spread
- Reflective: More directional, efficient

BEAUTY DISH:
- Medium softness (between softbox & bare bulb)
- Circular catchlight in eyes
- Beauty, fashion photography

SNOOT:
- Narrow beam (spotlight effect)
- Hair light, background accent

GRID:
- Controls light spread (prevents spill)
- Directional
```

## Composition

```markdown
RULE OF THIRDS:
- Divide frame into 9 sections (3×3 grid)
- Place subject on intersections
- Horizon on top or bottom third (not center)

EXAMPLE:
- Portrait: Eye on top-right intersection
- Landscape: Horizon on bottom third (emphasize sky)

BREAK THE RULE:
- Center composition (symmetry, reflections)
- Minimalism

---

LEADING LINES:
- Guide viewer's eye to subject
- Roads, rivers, fences, pathways
- Converge at subject

---

FRAMING:
- Use natural frames (doorways, windows, trees)
- Draws attention to subject
- Adds depth

---

SYMMETRY:
- Balanced, harmonious
- Architecture (buildings, bridges)
- Reflections (water, mirrors)

---

NEGATIVE SPACE:
- Empty space around subject
- Minimalist
- Subject stands out
- Breathing room

---

DEPTH:
- Foreground, mid-ground, background
- Landscape: Flowers (foreground), mountain (background)
- Adds dimension

---

PERSPECTIVE:
- Eye level: Neutral (everyday view)
- Low angle: Look up (powerful, dramatic)
- High angle: Look down (vulnerable, small)
- Bird's eye: Directly above (patterns, abstract)
```

## Post-Processing

```markdown
LIGHTROOM (Editing workflow):

1. IMPORT:
   - Copy to hard drive (backup!)
   - Add to catalog

2. CULLING:
   - Select best shots (star rating, flags)
   - Delete rejects (out of focus, bad expression)

3. BASIC ADJUSTMENTS:
   
   EXPOSURE:
   - Brightness (overall)
   - Slider: -2 to +2
   
   CONTRAST:
   - Difference between lights & darks
   - Increase: Punch, drama
   - Decrease: Flat, moody
   
   HIGHLIGHTS:
   - Brightest areas
   - Lower to recover blown (overexposed) areas
   
   SHADOWS:
   - Darkest areas
   - Raise to reveal detail
   
   WHITES / BLACKS:
   - Fine-tune endpoints
   - Hold Alt/Option (see clipping: red = blown highlights, blue = crushed blacks)

4. COLOR:
   
   WHITE BALANCE:
   - Temperature (blue ← → yellow)
   - Tint (green ← → magenta)
   - Presets: Daylight, Cloudy, Shade, Tungsten
   - Eyedropper: Click neutral gray (auto-correct)
   
   VIBRANCE:
   - Subtle saturation boost (protects skin tones)
   - Use this (not saturation slider)
   
   SATURATION:
   - All colors equally
   - Easy to overdo (neon look)

5. DETAIL:
   
   SHARPENING:
   - Amount: 40-60 (portraits), 70-90 (landscapes)
   - Masking: Hold Alt, drag Masking slider (sharpen only edges)
   
   NOISE REDUCTION:
   - Luminance: 20-40 (smooth grain)
   - Color: 25 (remove color noise)
   - High ISO shots need more

6. EXPORT:
   - Format: JPEG (sharing), TIFF (print, archival)
   - Resolution: 300 DPI (print), 72 DPI (web)
   - Quality: 80-90% (JPEG, balance size/quality)
   - Resize: 2048px long edge (web), original (print)

---

PHOTOSHOP (Advanced retouching):

FREQUENCY SEPARATION:
- Separate texture (pores) from color (tone)
- Smooth skin without losing detail
- Blur color layer (blemishes), keep texture layer

DODGING & BURNING:
- Dodge: Lighten (highlights, brighten eyes)
- Burn: Darken (shadows, add depth)
- Subtle (5-10% opacity)
- Non-destructive (Curves adjustment layer + layer mask)

BLEMISH REMOVAL:
- Spot Healing Brush (auto-fill)
- Clone Stamp (manual, sample nearby area)
- Healing Brush (blend)

LIQUIFY:
- Warp, reshape (slimming, adjusting features)
- Subtle! (don't overdo)
- Freeze Mask (protect areas from warping)
```
