## Design Principles

```markdown
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN:

1. LINE:
   - Horizontal (calm, stability): Shelves, tables
   - Vertical (strength, height): Columns, tall cabinets
   - Diagonal (movement, energy): Stairs, angled walls
   - Curved (softness, flow): Arched doorways, round furniture

2. FORM (Shape):
   - Geometric (squares, circles, triangles): Modern, structured
   - Organic (natural, irregular): Traditional, relaxed
   - 3D volume (furniture, architectural features)

3. COLOR:
   - Hue (name: red, blue, green)
   - Value (lightness/darkness)
   - Saturation (intensity)
   - See Color Theory section below

4. TEXTURE:
   - Visual (how it looks): Smooth, rough, glossy
   - Tactile (how it feels): Soft velvet, hard metal
   - Variety creates interest (all smooth = boring)

5. PATTERN:
   - Repetition of motifs (florals, stripes, geometric)
   - Scale matters (large patterns = small rooms overwhelmed)
   - Mix: One large, one medium, one small scale

6. LIGHT:
   - Natural (windows, skylights)
   - Artificial (ambient, task, accent)
   - Affects color perception (colors look different in daylight vs LED)

7. SPACE:
   - Positive (filled with furniture, objects)
   - Negative (empty space, breathing room)
   - Balance both (don't overcrowd)

---

PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN:

BALANCE:
- Symmetrical (formal): Matching pairs (2 lamps, 2 chairs)
- Asymmetrical (informal): Different but equal visual weight
- Radial (circular): Around central point (chandelier over round table)

RHYTHM:
- Repetition (same element multiple times: 3 blue pillows)
- Progression (gradual change: Small → Medium → Large vases)
- Transition (smooth flow: Curved archway leads eye)

EMPHASIS (Focal Point):
- One dominant feature (fireplace, artwork, view)
- Draw eye immediately
- Don't compete (too many focal points = confusion)

CONTRAST:
- Opposite elements (dark vs light, smooth vs rough)
- Creates visual interest
- Example: Black accent wall in white room

SCALE & PROPORTION:
- Scale: Size relative to space
  * Large sofa in small room = overwhelming
  * Tiny art above large sofa = lost
- Proportion: Relationship between elements
  * Golden ratio: 1:1.618 (pleasing to eye)
  * Rule of thirds (hang art 1/3 from ceiling, not centered)

HARMONY & UNITY:
- All elements work together (cohesive theme)
- Repeat colors, materials, styles
- Not too matchy (boring) but not chaotic

## Color Theory

```markdown
COLOR WHEEL:

PRIMARY:
- Red, Blue, Yellow
- Cannot be created by mixing

SECONDARY:
- Orange (red + yellow)
- Green (blue + yellow)
- Purple (red + blue)

TERTIARY:
- Red-orange, yellow-orange, yellow-green, blue-green, blue-purple, red-purple

---

COLOR SCHEMES:

MONOCHROMATIC:
- One color, different shades/tints
- Example: Navy, sky blue, powder blue
- Pros: Cohesive, easy
- Cons: Can be boring (add texture, pattern for interest)

ANALOGOUS:
- 3 colors next to each other on wheel
- Example: Blue, blue-green, green
- Pros: Harmonious, natural
- Cons: Low contrast (pick one dominant)

COMPLEMENTARY:
- Opposite on wheel (high contrast)
- Example: Blue & orange, red & green
- Pros: Bold, energetic
- Cons: Can be jarring (use 60-30-10 rule)

SPLIT-COMPLEMENTARY:
- One color + two adjacent to complement
- Example: Blue, red-orange, yellow-orange
- Pros: High contrast but softer than complementary

TRIADIC:
- 3 colors evenly spaced
- Example: Red, yellow, blue (primary)
- Pros: Vibrant, playful
- Cons: Hard to balance (pick one dominant)

---

60-30-10 RULE:

- 60%: Dominant color (walls, large furniture)
- 30%: Secondary color (smaller furniture, curtains)
- 10%: Accent color (pillows, art, accessories)

Example:
- 60% Beige (walls, sofa)
- 30% Navy (accent chairs, curtains)
- 10% Gold (pillows, lamp, vase)

---

COLOR PSYCHOLOGY:

WARM COLORS (Red, Orange, Yellow):
- Energizing, stimulating
- Appear closer (make room feel smaller, cozier)
- Use: Dining rooms, kitchens, social spaces

COOL COLORS (Blue, Green, Purple):
- Calming, relaxing
- Appear farther (make room feel larger)
- Use: Bedrooms, bathrooms, offices

NEUTRALS (White, Gray, Beige, Black):
- Versatile, timeless
- Backdrop for accent colors
- White: Clean, spacious (can feel cold if all white)
- Gray: Sophisticated, modern
- Beige/Tan: Warm, inviting
- Black: Dramatic, grounding (use sparingly)

---

UNDERTONES:

Every color has undertone (warm or cool)

WARM UNDERTONES:
- Yellow, red, orange hints
- Example: Beige with yellow (warm beige)

COOL UNDERTONES:
- Blue, green, purple hints
- Example: Gray with blue (cool gray)

MATCH UNDERTONES:
- Don't mix warm beige with cool gray (clashes)
- Test paint samples in room (light affects undertones)
```

## Space Planning

```markdown
PROGRAMMING (Needs assessment):

CLIENT INTERVIEW:
- Who uses space? (family of 4, single professional, couple)
- How is it used? (formal dining vs casual, work from home, entertain often)
- Storage needs? (books, clothes, kitchen gadgets)
- Style preferences? (modern, traditional, eclectic)
- Budget? (realistic range)
- Timeline? (rush job or flexible)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Function first** - Beautiful but not livable = failure (measure, plan traffic flow)
2. **Client's style** - Not yours (some designers impose taste, listen to client)
3. **Budget realism** - Set expectations (luxury look on Ikea budget = disappointment)
4. **Quality over quantity** - Invest in key pieces (sofa, bed), save on accessories
5. **Lighting matters** - Can make or break space (layer: ambient, task, accent)
