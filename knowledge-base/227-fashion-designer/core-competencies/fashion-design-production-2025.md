## Design Process

```markdown
INSPIRATION & RESEARCH:

SOURCES:
- Art (paintings, sculptures, museums)
- Nature (textures, colors, patterns)
- Architecture (structure, lines, materials)
- Street style (what people actually wear)
- Vintage fashion (archives, thrift stores)
- Travel (cultural dress, textiles)
- Trends (fashion weeks, WGSN, trend forecasting)

MOOD BOARD:
- Collect images (Pinterest, magazine clippings)
- Color palette (5-8 colors)
- Textures, fabrics
- Silhouettes, details
- Unify theme (cohesive story)

---

CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT:

TARGET CUSTOMER:
- Demographics (age, gender, income, location)
- Psychographics (lifestyle, values, interests)
- Example: "25-35 year-old urban professional, values sustainability, willing to pay for quality"

COLLECTION THEME:
- Story (what's the inspiration?)
- Mood (romantic, edgy, minimal, bohemian?)
- Season (Spring/Summer, Fall/Winter)
  * S/S: Lightweight, bright colors, breathable
  * F/W: Layering, darker colors, warmth

NUMBER OF LOOKS:
- Capsule collection: 6-12 pieces
- Full collection: 20-40 looks
- Runway show: 25-50 looks

---

SKETCHING:

CROQUIS (Fashion figure):
- Elongated (8-10 heads tall vs realistic 7.5)
- Emphasizes clothes (not anatomical accuracy)
- Poses (dynamic, show movement)

FLAT SKETCH (Technical drawing):
- Front and back views
- To scale (realistic proportions)
- Details (seams, topstitching, pockets, buttons)
- Used for: Pattern makers, manufacturers

RENDER:
- Color, fabric texture
- Markers, colored pencils, digital (Procreate, Illustrator)
- Shows final look

---

FABRIC SELECTION:

NATURAL FIBERS:
- Cotton: Breathable, soft, wrinkles easily
  * Use: T-shirts, jeans, casual wear
- Linen: Cool, textured, wrinkles (deliberately relaxed look)
  * Use: Summer dresses, suits
- Silk: Luxurious, drapes well, delicate
  * Use: Blouses, dresses, lingerie
- Wool: Warm, insulating, can be itchy
  * Use: Coats, suits, sweaters
- Leather: Durable, ages well, expensive
  * Use: Jackets, bags, shoes

SYNTHETIC FIBERS:
- Polyester: Cheap, durable, doesn't breathe (sweaty)
  * Use: Activewear, fast fashion
- Nylon: Strong, elastic, quick-dry
  * Use: Activewear, hosiery, outerwear
- Spandex/Elastane: Stretch (mixed with other fibers)
  * Use: Leggings, swimwear, fitted garments

SUSTAINABLE:
- Organic cotton (no pesticides)
- Tencel/Lyocell (wood pulp, eco-friendly process)
- Recycled polyester (from plastic bottles)
- Deadstock (leftover fabric from other designers)

FABRIC WEIGHT:
- Lightweight: Chiffon, organza (0-5 oz/sq yd)
- Medium: Poplin, twill (5-10 oz)
- Heavyweight: Denim, canvas (10+ oz)

---

DRAPING:

PROCESS:
- Pin fabric on dress form (mannequin)
- Sculpt, shape (3D design)
- Mark seamlines
- Transfer to pattern

BENEFITS:
- See how fabric moves, drapes
- Unexpected designs (happy accidents)
- Good for: Evening gowns, draped silhouettes

CHALLENGES:
- Uses more fabric (expensive for sampling)
- Harder to scale (each size needs new drape)

## Pattern Making

```markdown
MEASUREMENTS:

WOMEN'S (US standard sizes):
- Size 0: Bust 31", Waist 24", Hip 34"
- Size 4: Bust 33", Waist 26", Hip 36"
- Size 8: Bust 35.5", Waist 28.5", Hip 38.5"
- Size 12: Bust 38", Waist 31", Hip 41"
- Size 16: Bust 41", Waist 34", Hip 44"

KEY MEASUREMENTS:
- Bust (fullest part, across chest)
- Waist (natural waist, narrowest part)
- Hip (fullest part, 7-9" below waist)
- Inseam (crotch to ankle)
- Shoulder to waist
- Sleeve length

---

BASIC PATTERNS (Blocks/Slopers):

- Bodice (torso, fitted)
- Skirt (A-line, pencil, gathered)
- Pants (straight, fitted)
- Sleeve (set-in, raglan, kimono)

MODIFY BLOCKS:
- Add seam allowance (1/2" - 5/8")
- Add ease (garment slightly larger than body for comfort)
  * Close-fitting: 0-1" ease
  * Fitted: 1-2" ease
  * Loose: 3-5" ease
- Style lines (princess seams, yoke, pleats, darts)

---

GRADING (Sizing):

- Start with sample size (usually size 4-6)
- Grade up and down (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16)
- Rules: Each size 1-2" increment (bust, waist, hip)
- Software: Optitex, Gerber AccuMark (automated grading)

---

MARKER MAKING:

- Layout pattern pieces on fabric (minimize waste)
- Consider:
  * Grain line (lengthwise, crosswise, bias)
  * Nap (one-way texture like velvet)
  * Pattern matching (stripes, plaids)
- Efficiency: 70-85% fabric utilization (good), 85%+ (excellent)

---

SAMPLE MAKING:

MUSLINS (Test garments):
- Cheap fabric (muslin, calico)
- Fit test (adjust pattern before cutting expensive fabric)
- Fitting model (ideally, on person or dress form)

FIT ADJUSTMENTS:
- Too tight: Add width
- Too loose: Take in
- Length (shorten, lengthen)
- Common issues:
  * Pulling across bust (need more ease)
  * Gaping neckline (reduce, adjust shoulder slope)
  * Crotch too long/short (adjust rise)

FINAL SAMPLE:
- Made in actual fabric
- Finished construction (all details)
- Used for: Photoshoots, showroom sales, runway
```

## Construction Techniques

```markdown
SEAMS:

PLAIN SEAM:
- Most common
- Right sides together, stitch 5/8" from edge
- Press open or to one side

FRENCH SEAM:
- Enclosed (clean finish, no raw edges)
- Use: Sheer fabrics, delicates
- Steps:
  1. Wrong sides together, stitch 1/4"
  2. Press open
  3. Fold right sides together, stitch 3/8" (enclosing first seam)

FLAT-FELLED SEAM:
- Durable, topstitched
- Use: Jeans, shirts (visible seam)
- Steps:
  1. Plain seam
  2. Press both seam allowances to one side
  3. Trim under layer to 1/4"
  4. Fold top layer over, enclosing trimmed edge
  5. Topstitch

---

HEMS:

SINGLE-FOLD HEM:
- Fold once, stitch
- Quick, casual finish

DOUBLE-FOLD HEM:
- Fold twice (encloses raw edge)
- Clean, durable

BLIND HEM:
- Nearly invisible from outside
- Use: Dress pants, skirts
- Hand-sewn or machine blind hem stitch

ROLLED HEM:
- Very narrow (1/8" or less)
- Use: Scarves, lingerie, sheer fabrics
- Rolled hem foot (machine) or hand-rolled

---

CLOSURES:

ZIPPER:
- Centered (seam down middle)
- Lapped (one side overlaps)
- Invisible (hidden in seam)
- Install: Basting, zipper foot, remove basting after

BUTTONS & BUTTONHOLES:
- Buttonhole size: Button diameter + thickness + 1/8"
- Placement: Horizontal (jackets, shirts), Vertical (cuffs, plackets)
- Sew-through vs Shank buttons

HOOKS & EYES:
- Use: Waistbands, back necklines (hidden closure)
- Hook catches eye

SNAPS:
- Quick closure
- Use: Baby clothes, light-weight garments
- Sew-on vs press-on (metal prongs)

---

FINISHING:

SEAM FINISHES:
- Pinking (zigzag cut, prevents fraying)
- Serging/Overlocking (encloses edge, professional)
- Binding (bias tape covers edge)

PRESSING:
- Essential! (makes or breaks garment)
- Press as you sew (seams, darts, hems)
- Tools:
  * Iron (steam)
  * Pressing ham (curves, darts)
  * Tailor's board (small areas, sleeves)
  * Pressing cloth (protects delicate fabrics)

INTERFACING:
- Adds structure, stability
- Use: Collars, cuffs, waistbands, button plackets
- Types:
  * Fusible (iron-on adhesive)
  * Sew-in (stitch to garment)
- Weight: Lightweight (sheers), medium (shirts), heavyweight (coats)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Fit is everything** - Beautiful design, poor fit = unwearable (test on real bodies)
2. **Know your customer** - Design for them (not yourself)
3. **Quality over quantity** - Well-made > trendy fast fashion
4. **Costing matters** - Understand margins (profitable or hobby?)
