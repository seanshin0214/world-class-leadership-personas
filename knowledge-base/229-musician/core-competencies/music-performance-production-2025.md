## Instrument Practice

```markdown
EFFECTIVE PRACTICE:

WARM-UP (10-15 min):
- Scales (major, minor, pentatonic)
  * Start slow, increase speed
  * Focus: Technique (finger placement, breath control, bow control)
- Arpeggios (broken chords)
- Technical exercises (Hanon for piano, long tones for wind instruments)

FOCUSED PRACTICE (30-45 min):
- Slow practice (50-70% tempo, perfect technique)
- Chunk difficult sections (4-8 bars at a time, repeat 10-20×)
- Metronome (start slow, increase by 5 BPM when mastered)
- Record yourself (audio/video, identify mistakes)

RUN-THROUGH (10-15 min):
- Play piece start to finish (simulate performance)
- Don't stop for mistakes (keep momentum)

COOL-DOWN (5 min):
- Play for fun (improvise, favorite song)
- Reflect (what improved? what needs work tomorrow?)

---

PRACTICE SCHEDULE:

BEGINNER (30 min/day):
- 10 min: Warm-up (scales)
- 15 min: Learn new piece
- 5 min: Review old pieces

INTERMEDIATE (60 min/day):
- 15 min: Warm-up (scales, arpeggios, technical exercises)
- 30 min: Focused practice (2-3 pieces, 10 min each)
- 10 min: Sight-reading (new music)
- 5 min: Improvisation/fun

ADVANCED (2-3 hours/day):
- 30 min: Warm-up (scales all keys, arpeggios, etudes)
- 90 min: Repertoire (3-4 pieces, 20-30 min each)
- 30 min: Sight-reading, theory, ear training

---

TECHNIQUE TIPS:

PIANO:
- Posture: Sit upright, elbows level with keys
- Curved fingers (not flat, use fingertips)
- Relax wrists (avoid tension, causes fatigue/injury)
- Practice hands separately, then together

GUITAR:
- Finger placement: Behind fret (not on top), fingertips
- Barre chords: Thumb behind neck, use edge of index finger
- Alternate picking (down-up, speed)
- Calluses (fingertips harden, less pain over time)

VOICE:
- Breath support (diaphragm, not shoulders)
- Vowel shaping ("ah", "eh", "ee", "oh", "oo")
- Avoid tension (throat, jaw, tongue)
- Hydration (drink water, avoid dairy before singing)

DRUMS:
- Grip: Fulcrum between thumb and index finger, loose grip
- Rebound: Let stick bounce (don't fight it)
- Practice rudiments (single stroke, double stroke, paradiddle)
- Metronome (timing crucial for drums)

## Music Production

```markdown
DAW (Digital Audio Workstation):

POPULAR DAWS:
- Ableton Live (electronic, live performance, loop-based)
- FL Studio (hip-hop, electronic, pattern-based)
- Logic Pro (Mac only, all-genre, professional)
- Pro Tools (industry standard, recording, mixing)
- GarageBand (Mac/iOS, beginner-friendly, free)
- Reaper (affordable, $60, lightweight, powerful)

WORKFLOW:
1. COMPOSITION (Write melody, chords, drums)
2. ARRANGEMENT (Structure: intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro)
3. RECORDING (Audio, MIDI)
4. EDITING (Timing, pitch, cleanup)
5. MIXING (Balance levels, EQ, compression, effects)
6. MASTERING (Final polish, loudness, prepare for distribution)

---

RECORDING:

AUDIO RECORDING (Microphones):

DYNAMIC MICS (Rugged, loud sources):
- Shure SM57 (guitars, snare drum)
- Shure SM58 (live vocals)

CONDENSER MICS (Sensitive, detail):
- Audio-Technica AT2020 (budget, $100)
- Rode NT1-A (mid-range, $200)
- Neumann U87 (professional, $3,500)

MIC PLACEMENT:
- Vocals: 6-12 inches from mic, pop filter (reduces plosives: "p", "b")
- Acoustic guitar: 12th fret, 6-12 inches away
- Drums: Close mic each drum (kick, snare, toms) + overhead mics (cymbals, room)

RECORDING TIPS:
- Quiet room (reduce background noise)
- Treat acoustics (foam panels, bass traps)
- Gain staging (input not too loud, avoid clipping, peak -6dB to -3dB)
- Monitor latency (use direct monitoring if >10ms lag)

---

MIDI RECORDING:

MIDI KEYBOARD/CONTROLLER:
- Input notes (velocity, duration, pitch)
- Edit after recording (quantize, transpose, change instrument)

VIRTUAL INSTRUMENTS (VST/AU):
- Piano: Keyscape, Addictive Keys
- Strings: Spitfire Audio, EastWest
- Drums: Superior Drummer, Addictive Drums
- Synths: Serum, Massive, Omnisphere

MIDI EDITING:
- Quantize (snap to grid, tighten timing)
- Humanize (add slight randomness, avoid robotic sound)
- Velocity editing (dynamics, accents)
- Transpose (change key)

---

MIXING:

LEVELS:
- Balance instruments (vocals loudest, bass/drums foundation, other instruments support)
- Headroom (-6dB to -3dB peak, leave room for mastering)

EQ (Equalization):
- Cut mud (200-500 Hz, make space)
- Boost presence (2-5 kHz, clarity for vocals)
- High-pass filter (cut below 80-100 Hz, remove rumble except bass/kick)

COMPRESSION:
- Reduce dynamic range (loud parts quieter, quiet parts louder)
- Settings:
  * Threshold: Where compression starts (e.g., -20dB)
  * Ratio: How much compression (4:1 = gentle, 10:1 = heavy)
  * Attack: How fast (slow for drums punch, fast for vocals)
  * Release: How fast to recover (fast = pumping, slow = smooth)
  * Makeup gain: Increase output after compression

REVERB (Space, depth):
- Room (small, intimate)
- Hall (large, concert hall)
- Plate (bright, smooth)
- Amount: 10-30% wet (don't drown in reverb)

DELAY (Echo):
- Slapback (50-100ms, rockabilly vocals)
- Quarter note (rhythmic, sync to BPM)
- Ping-pong (stereo, bounces left-right)

PANNING (Stereo field):
- Center: Vocals, bass, kick, snare
- Left/Right: Guitars, keys, percussion (spread out, create width)
- LCR mixing (Left-Center-Right only, no in-between)

---

MASTERING:

GOAL: Final polish, prepare for distribution (Spotify, Apple Music, CD)

CHAIN:
1. EQ (subtle corrections, overall tonal balance)
2. Compression (glue mix together, 1-2 dB gain reduction)
3. Limiting (increase loudness, prevent clipping)
   - Target: -14 LUFS (Spotify/Apple Music normalize to this)
   - True peak: -1 dB (prevent distortion on streaming)

TOOLS:
- iZotope Ozone (all-in-one mastering suite)
- FabFilter Pro-L 2 (limiter)
- Waves L2 (limiter)

OR: Hire mastering engineer ($50-$150/song)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Theory foundation** - Understand what you're playing (scales, chords, progressions)
2. **Consistent practice** - Daily practice > marathon sessions (muscle memory, technique)
3. **Quality over quantity** - 30 min focused > 2 hours distracted (slow, deliberate practice)
4. **Learn by ear** - Transcribe favorite songs (develops ear, understanding)
5. **Multiple income streams** - Don't rely on one (streaming, live, teaching, sync)
