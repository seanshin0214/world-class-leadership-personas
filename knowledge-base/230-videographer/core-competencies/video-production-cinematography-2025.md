## Camera Fundamentals

```markdown
EXPOSURE TRIANGLE:

SHUTTER SPEED (Motion blur, exposure):
- Fast (1/1000s): Freeze action (sports, wildlife)
- Slow (1/60s): Motion blur (cinematic look)
- 180° SHUTTER RULE: Shutter speed = 2× frame rate
  * 24fps → 1/48s shutter (or 1/50s)
  * 60fps → 1/120s shutter
  * Why: Natural motion blur (looks cinematic, not stuttery)

APERTURE (Depth of field, exposure):
- Wide open (f/1.4, f/2.8): Shallow depth, blurry background (subject isolated)
  * Use: Interviews, portraits, cinematic look
- Stopped down (f/8, f/11): Deep depth, everything in focus
  * Use: Landscapes, group shots, architecture
- Sweet spot: f/4-f/5.6 (balance sharpness + depth)

ISO (Sensitivity, noise):
- Low (100-400): Clean image, bright light
- High (1600-6400): Noisy/grainy, low light
- Native ISO: Camera's optimal (usually 800-1600, varies by camera)
- Rule: Keep ISO as low as possible (add light, don't raise ISO)

---

FRAME RATES:

24fps (23.976): Cinematic, film look (used in movies, narrative)
30fps (29.97): Video look (broadcast, news, sports)
60fps: Smooth, can slow down to 24fps (2.5× slow-motion)
120fps: Slow-motion (5× at 24fps)

WHICH TO USE:
- Narrative, commercial, music video: 24fps
- Vlog, documentary, event: 30fps
- Action, sports, B-roll for slow-mo: 60fps+

---

RESOLUTION:

1080p (Full HD): 1920×1080
4K (UHD): 3840×2160 (4× pixels of 1080p)
6K, 8K: Higher resolution (crop flexibility, future-proof)

WHEN TO SHOOT 4K:
- Reframe in post (punch in, no quality loss)
- Slow-motion (60fps 4K → 24fps smooth)
- Delivery in 4K (YouTube, client request)

WHEN 1080p IS ENOUGH:
- Fast turnaround (smaller files, faster export)
- Limited storage (4K files huge: 1 min ≈ 1GB)
- Final delivery 1080p (social media, most web content)

---

COMPOSITION:

RULE OF THIRDS:
- Divide frame into 3×3 grid
- Place subject on intersection (not center)
- Horizon on top or bottom third (not middle)

HEADROOM:
- Space above subject's head
- Too much: Subject feels small, lost
- Too little: Claustrophobic, cut off
- Right amount: 10-20% of frame height

LEAD ROOM:
- Space in direction subject is facing/moving
- Example: Interview, subject looks left → more space on left side
- Example: Car moving right → more space on right side

DEPTH:
- Foreground, midground, background (add layers)
- Example: Flowers in foreground (blurry), person in midground (sharp), mountains in background

MOVEMENT:
- Static: Locked-off shot (tripod, no movement)
- Pan: Horizontal rotation (left/right)
- Tilt: Vertical rotation (up/down)
- Dolly: Camera moves forward/backward
- Truck: Camera moves left/right
- Crane/jib: Camera moves up/down on arm
- Gimbal/steadicam: Smooth handheld movement

## Lighting

```markdown
3-POINT LIGHTING (Standard setup):

1. KEY LIGHT (Main, brightest):
   - Position: 45° angle from camera, slightly above eye level
   - Creates shadows (defines face)

2. FILL LIGHT (Soften shadows):
   - Position: Opposite side of key, lower intensity (50% of key)
   - Reduces contrast (shadows not too dark)

3. BACK LIGHT (Separation):
   - Position: Behind subject, above, pointing down
   - Rim of light (separates subject from background)

RESULT: Dimensional, professional look

---

LIGHTING QUALITY:

HARD LIGHT (Small source, harsh shadows):
- Direct sunlight, bare bulb
- Use: Dramatic, high contrast, suspense
- Example: Film noir, horror

SOFT LIGHT (Large source, soft shadows):
- Overcast day, softbox, umbrella, diffuser
- Use: Flattering, natural, interviews
- Example: Beauty, commercial, corporate

HOW TO SOFTEN LIGHT:
- Increase source size (larger softbox)
- Bounce off wall/ceiling (indirect)
- Diffuse (silk, translucent material in front)
- Move closer (inverse square law, closer = softer)

---

NATURAL LIGHT:

GOLDEN HOUR (1 hour after sunrise, 1 hour before sunset):
- Warm, soft, low angle
- Best time for outdoor shoots (beautiful, flattering)

BLUE HOUR (Twilight, 20-40 min after sunset):
- Cool, blue tones
- Use: Cityscapes, night scenes (but still some light)

MIDDAY (Harsh, overhead):
- Worst time (unflattering shadows, squinting)
- Solutions: Shade, diffuser, bounce light into shadows

OVERCAST:
- Soft, even (natural softbox)
- Good for interviews, portraits (no harsh shadows)

---

PRACTICAL LIGHTING (In-frame light sources):

EXAMPLES:
- Lamp in scene
- Window light
- Car headlights
- Candles, fire
- Neon signs, streetlights

BENEFITS:
- Motivated light (makes sense, natural)
- Adds production value (looks cinematic)

TECHNIQUES:
- Enhance with off-camera lights (make practical brighter or match color)
- Shape light (flags, barn doors to control spill)
```

## Audio

```markdown
RULE: AUDIO > VIDEO (People tolerate bad video, not bad audio)

MICROPHONE TYPES:

LAVALIER (Clip-on, hidden under shirt):
- Pros: Hands-free, consistent volume (moves with subject)
- Cons: Clothing rustle, limited mobility (wired), expensive (wireless)
- Use: Interviews, presentations, events
- Examples: Rode Wireless Go II, Sennheiser EW 112P

SHOTGUN (Boom, directional):
- Pros: Natural sound, keeps mic out of frame
- Cons: Requires boom operator, picks up off-axis noise
- Use: Film, narrative, sit-down interviews
- Examples: Rode NTG3, Sennheiser MKH 416

HANDHELD:
- Pros: Reporter look, durable
- Cons: In frame, handling noise
- Use: Interviews, ENG (electronic news gathering)
- Examples: Shure SM58, Electro-Voice RE50

---

RECORDING TIPS:

GAIN/LEVELS:
- Peak: -12dB to -6dB (not clipping, not too quiet)
- If clipping (red, distorted): Lower gain
- If too quiet (hard to hear): Raise gain (but not too much, adds noise)

MONITORING:
- Use headphones (always, not just camera display)
- Listen for: Background noise, wind, handling, clipping

REDUNDANCY:
- Record to camera + external recorder (backup if one fails)
- Dual-system sound (sync in post, better quality)

---

LOCATION AUDIO CHALLENGES:

WIND:
- Solution: Windscreen (foam, deadcat)
- Indoors: AC vents (white noise) → turn off if possible

ECHO/REVERB (Hard surfaces):
- Solution: Soft materials (blankets, rugs, furniture absorb sound)
- Get mic close to subject (reduce room noise)

AMBIENT NOISE (Traffic, planes, people):
- Solutions:
  * Shoot during quiet times (early morning)
  * Directional mic (shotgun, reject off-axis)
  * Get close (higher signal-to-noise ratio)
  * ADR (re-record dialogue in post, if narrative)

ROOM TONE:
- Record 30-60 sec of silence (background ambience)
- Use in editing (fill gaps, smooth transitions)

## Cinematography Techniques

```markdown
SHOT SIZES:

EXTREME WIDE SHOT (EWS):
- Entire scene, subject small
- Use: Establish location, scale

WIDE SHOT (WS):
- Full body
- Use: Show action, context

MEDIUM SHOT (MS):
- Waist up
- Use: Dialogue, interaction

CLOSE-UP (CU):
- Head and shoulders
- Use: Emotion, reaction

EXTREME CLOSE-UP (ECU):
- Eyes, hands, object detail
- Use: Intensity, detail, cutaways

---

CAMERA ANGLES:

EYE LEVEL:
- Neutral, natural
- Use: Most common, interviews, dialogue

LOW ANGLE:
- Camera below subject, looking up
- Effect: Subject looks powerful, dominant
- Use: Hero shot, authority figure

HIGH ANGLE:
- Camera above subject, looking down
- Effect: Subject looks weak, vulnerable
- Use: Victim, child POV

DUTCH ANGLE (Tilted):
- Camera rotated (horizon not level)
- Effect: Disorientation, unease
- Use: Suspense, action, creative shots

---

CAMERA MOVEMENT:

STATIC (Locked-off):
- No movement (tripod)
- Use: Interviews, establishing shots, stable

PAN/TILT:
- Smooth rotation (slow, not whip)
- Use: Follow subject, reveal environment

DOLLY (Push in/Pull out):
- Camera moves toward/away from subject
- Effect: Draw viewer in, or pull away for reflection
- Use: Emotional moment, reveal

TRACKING/TRUCKING:
- Camera follows subject (parallel)
- Use: Walk-and-talk, dynamic movement

HANDHELD:
- Camera held by operator (slight shake)
- Effect: Intimate, documentary feel, urgency
- Use: Run-and-gun, documentary, action

GIMBAL/STEADICAM:
- Smooth handheld (no shake)
- Use: Fluid movement, follow subject through space

---

VISUAL STORYTELLING:

SHOT SEQUENCE (Build scene):
1. ESTABLISHING SHOT (Wide, where are we?)
2. MEDIUM SHOTS (Who's here, what's happening?)
3. CLOSE-UPS (Details, emotion, reactions)
4. CUTAWAYS (B-roll, context, transitions)

MATCH CUT (Connect shots):
- Action match (mid-action, continue in next shot)
- Graphic match (similar shapes/composition)
- Sound match (sound continues across cut)

CONTINUITY:
- Screen direction (if character exits frame right, enters next shot from left)
- Eye line (if looking right, next shot shows what's on right)
- 180° RULE: Imaginary line between subjects, don't cross (keeps screen direction consistent)

B-ROLL:
- Supplemental footage (not main action)
- Use: Cover edits, illustrate narration, add visual interest
- Examples: Hands typing, cityscape, product close-up
```

## Editing

```markdown
SOFTWARE:

BEGINNER: iMovie (free, Mac), DaVinci Resolve (free, cross-platform)
INTERMEDIATE: Adobe Premiere Pro ($20/mo), Final Cut Pro ($300 one-time, Mac)
PROFESSIONAL: Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve Studio ($295 one-time)

---

WORKFLOW:

1. IMPORT:
   - Organize (bins/folders: A-roll, B-roll, audio, graphics)
   - Proxy workflow (if 4K, create lower-res copies for editing, faster)

2. ROUGH CUT:
   - Assemble story (main shots, structure)
   - Focus on pacing, story (not color, effects yet)
   - Music (temp track, find right mood)

3. FINE CUT:
   - Tighten (remove pauses, ums, weak moments)
   - B-roll (cover jump cuts, add visual interest)
   - Transitions (mostly cuts, occasional dissolve, avoid cheesy effects)

4. SOUND:
   - Music (adjust volume, duck under dialogue)
   - Sound effects (footsteps, door close, ambience)
   - Mix (dialogue loudest, music/sfx support)

5. COLOR GRADE:
   - Correct (balance exposure, white balance)
   - Grade (creative look, mood)
   - LUTs (Look-Up Tables, quick color styles)

6. EXPORT:
   - Resolution: Match delivery (4K, 1080p)
   - Codec: H.264 (web, most compatible), ProRes (high quality, archival)
   - Bitrate: 20-30 Mbps (1080p), 50-80 Mbps (4K)

---

EDITING PRINCIPLES:

PACING:
- Match mood (fast cuts = energy, slow cuts = contemplative)
- Vary shot lengths (not all 3 seconds, boring rhythm)
- Music drives pacing (cut on beat for energy)

CUTTING ON ACTION:
- Cut mid-movement (door opening, person sitting)
- Hides cut (viewer focused on action, not edit)

J-CUT & L-CUT:
- J-cut: Audio starts before video (hear knock, then see door)
- L-cut: Audio continues after video (person speaks, cut to listener, still hear speaker)
- Natural, conversational flow

MONTAGE:
- Series of short clips (show passage of time, build emotion)
- Example: Training montage, travel sequence, before/after

---

COLOR GRADING:

WORKFLOW:
1. CORRECT (Technical):
   - Exposure (not too dark/bright)
   - White balance (neutral colors, or warm/cool intentionally)
   - Contrast (blacks/whites not crushed, unless creative choice)

2. GRADE (Creative):
   - Teal & orange (popular, skin tones warm, shadows cool)
   - Desaturated (gritty, documentary)
   - High contrast (dramatic, film noir)
   - Faded (pastel, vintage, nostalgic)

TOOLS:
- Lumetri Color (Premiere)
- Color Wheels (DaVinci Resolve)
- LUTs (quick looks: Fuji, Kodak film emulations)

SCOPES:
- Waveform (check exposure)
- Vectorscope (check saturation, hue)
- Histogram (distribution of tones)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Story first** - Technical skills serve story (not the other way around)
2. **Audio = 50%** - Good video, bad audio = unwatchable (invest in audio)
3. **Lighting > Camera** - $500 camera + great lighting > $10K camera + bad lighting
4. **Shoot for edit** - Think about how shots will cut together (not just individual shots)
5. **Consistency** - Match shots (exposure, color, angle) for seamless editing
