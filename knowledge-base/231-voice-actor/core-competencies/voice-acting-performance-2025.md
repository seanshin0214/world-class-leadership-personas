## Vocal Fundamentals

```markdown
BREATH SUPPORT (Foundation of voice acting):

DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING:
- Breathe from belly (not chest)
- Inhale: Belly expands (diaphragm contracts, pulls lungs down)
- Exhale: Belly contracts (diaphragm relaxes)
- Benefits: More air, sustained sound, vocal control

EXERCISE:
1. Lie on back, hand on belly
2. Inhale through nose (4 counts), feel belly rise
3. Hold (4 counts)
4. Exhale through mouth (8 counts), belly falls
5. Repeat 10×

SUSTAINED SOUND:
- Inhale deeply
- Exhale on "sssss" (as long as possible, 20-30+ seconds goal)
- Keep volume consistent (don't fade)
- Practice with "shhhh", "zzzzz", "mmmm"

---

ARTICULATION (Clear speech):

CONSONANTS:
- Crisp, precise (especially P, T, K, D, B, G)
- Plosives (P, B, T, D, K, G): Quick burst of air
- Fricatives (F, V, S, Z, SH, TH): Friction, continuous sound

TONGUE TWISTERS (Practice):
- "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers" (P, precise)
- "Red leather, yellow leather" (L, R, tongue placement)
- "Unique New York" (Repeat 5× fast, vowel clarity)
- "She sells seashells by the seashore" (S, SH, airflow)

OVER-ARTICULATION:
- Exaggerate consonants (practice)
- Then dial back to natural (but still clear)
- On mic: Slightly less articulation needed (mic picks up more detail)

---

VOCAL RANGE & FLEXIBILITY:

PITCH:
- High, medium, low (practice speaking at different pitches)
- Don't strain (if uncomfortable, back off)
- Characters: Different pitch = different personality
  * High pitch: Young, excited, nervous
  * Low pitch: Authority, villain, mature
  * Mid pitch: Neutral, relatable

PACE:
- Fast: Excited, energetic, nervous
- Slow: Serious, thoughtful, menacing
- Vary pace (monotone = boring)

VOLUME:
- Loud: Commanding, angry, excited
- Soft: Intimate, secretive, scared
- Dynamic range (don't just speak at one volume)

---

VOCAL WARM-UPS (Before recording session):

1. HUMMING (5 min):
   - Hum up and down scale (low to high)
   - Feels vibration in face (resonance)

2. LIP TRILLS (2 min):
   - Blow air through lips (like motorboat sound)
   - Relaxes lips, breath support

3. TONGUE TRILLS (2 min):
   - Roll R's (Spanish "rrrr")
   - If can't roll R's: Tongue against roof of mouth, slide forward making "tuh tuh tuh"

4. SIRENS (2 min):
   - Slide voice from lowest to highest pitch on "ooo" or "eee"
   - Smooth transition (no breaks)

5. STRETCHES:
   - Neck rolls (gently, no forcing)
   - Jaw massage (release tension)
   - Shoulder shrugs

6. TONGUE TWISTERS (3 min):
   - Start slow, increase speed
   - Focus on clarity (not just speed)

HYDRATION:
- Water (room temp, not ice cold)
- Avoid: Dairy (mucus), caffeine (dries throat), alcohol (dries)
- Throat coat tea (soothes)
```

## Character Development

```markdown
SCRIPT ANALYSIS:

READ SCRIPT THOROUGHLY:
1. Who is the character? (Age, gender, personality, background)
2. What do they want? (Objective, motivation)
3. What's the situation? (Context, tone, emotions)
4. Who are they talking to? (Audience, another character)
5. What's the subtext? (What they really mean, underlying emotion)

EXAMPLE (Commercial):
Script: "Try our new coffee. It's amazing."
- Analysis:
  * Character: Coffee lover, enthusiastic
  * Objective: Convince listener to buy coffee
  * Tone: Friendly, excited, genuine
  * Subtext: "This coffee changed my life, you need to try it"

---

VOICE CHOICES:

AGE:
- Child (5-10): Higher pitch, lighter, energetic, shorter sentences
- Teen (13-18): Mid pitch, sometimes cracks (puberty), sarcastic, slang
- Young adult (20s-30s): Energetic, confident, varied
- Middle-aged (40s-50s): Mature, authoritative, grounded
- Elderly (60+): Lower pitch (women), rougher texture, slower pace, wisdom

GENDER:
- Male: Lower pitch, chest resonance
- Female: Higher pitch, head resonance
- Non-binary/Androgynous: Mid range, balance head and chest

ACCENT/DIALECT:
- Research (listen to native speakers, YouTube, interviews)
- Practice (mimic rhythm, intonation, specific sounds)
- Consistent (maintain throughout performance)
- Common: Southern US, British (RP, Cockney), Irish, Scottish, New York, Australian

EMOTION:
- Happy: Smile (affects sound, brighter tone), upward inflection, faster pace
- Sad: Lower pitch, slower pace, softer volume, downward inflection
- Angry: Louder, sharper consonants, faster pace, tension in voice
- Scared: Higher pitch, breathy, faster pace, shaky
- Confused: Upward inflection (questioning), slower pace, hesitant

---

CHARACTER VOICE CREATION:

PHYSICALITY (Body affects voice):
- Stand tall → confident, authoritative
- Slouch → tired, defeated
- Puff chest → arrogant, proud
- Hunch over → sneaky, villain, old

FACIAL EXPRESSIONS:
- Smile → happy, friendly sound
- Frown → sad, serious
- Raised eyebrows → surprised, curious
- Squint → suspicious, angry

PLACEMENT (Where sound resonates):
- Chest (low pitch, deep, powerful): Villain, narrator, authority
- Throat (mid pitch, natural): Most characters
- Nasal (higher pitch, whiny): Annoying character, nerd
- Head (highest pitch, bright): Fairy, young character

TEXTURE:
- Smooth: Narrator, romantic lead
- Rough/Raspy: Villain, tough character, elderly
- Breathy: Sexy, mysterious, scared
- Nasally: Nerd, annoying sidekick

PRACTICE:
- Create 5-10 distinct character voices
- Record, compare (ensure they're different)
- Practice switching between characters (flexibility)

## Recording Technique

```markdown
MICROPHONE TECHNIQUE:

DISTANCE:
- 6-12 inches from mic (standard)
- Closer: More intimate, bassy (proximity effect)
- Farther: Roomier, less direct
- Consistency: Maintain same distance (avoid volume changes)

ANGLE:
- Straight on (most common)
- Off-axis (slightly to side, reduce plosives)

PLOSIVES (P, B, T, D, K, G):
- Explosive air bursts (overload mic)
- Prevention:
  * Pop filter (mesh screen, absorbs air)
  * Angle mic slightly (air goes past mic)
  * Pull back on plosives (step back slightly on "P" words)

SIBILANCE (S, Z, SH):
- Harsh, piercing (painful in headphones)
- Prevention:
  * De-esser (plugin, reduces S sounds)
  * Angle mic slightly down (S sound goes over mic)
  * Pronunciation (soften S slightly)

BREATHING:
- Audible breaths (distracting)
- Prevention:
  * Breathe away from mic (turn head)
  * Quiet breaths (shallow, through nose)
  * Edit out in post (if needed)

---

HOME STUDIO SETUP:

EQUIPMENT (Budget):

MICROPHONE:
- USB (Beginner, $50-$150): Blue Yeti, Audio-Technica AT2020 USB, Rode NT-USB
- XLR (Professional, $100-$500 + interface needed): Shure SM7B, Rode NT1, Audio-Technica AT4040

AUDIO INTERFACE (If XLR mic):
- Focusrite Scarlett Solo ($100-$150)
- Behringer U-Phoria UM2 ($50, budget)

HEADPHONES:
- Closed-back (Audio-Technica ATH-M50x, Sony MDR-7506, $100-$150)
- Monitor sound (hear what you're recording)

POP FILTER ($10-$30):
- Mesh or foam (reduce plosives)

MIC STAND:
- Boom arm ($30-$100): Rode PSA1, Blue Compass
- Desktop stand (budget, less ideal)

---

ACOUSTIC TREATMENT:

PROBLEM: Reflections, echo (room sounds boxy)

SOLUTIONS:
- Vocal booth (expensive, $1,000+, ideal)
- DIY booth:
  * Closet (clothes absorb sound, soft surfaces)
  * Blanket fort (hang blankets around mic)
  * Acoustic panels ($30-$100 each, foam or fiberglass, place on walls behind/beside mic)
  * Bass traps (corners, absorb low frequencies)

AVOID:
- Hard surfaces (walls, windows, desk)
- Large empty rooms (echo)
- Background noise (AC, fan, traffic, neighbors)

TEST:
- Clap hands in room
- Echo/reverb? → Need treatment
- Dead sound (no echo)? → Good

---

RECORDING SOFTWARE (DAW):

FREE:
- Audacity (Windows, Mac, Linux - basic, good for beginners)
- GarageBand (Mac only)
- Reaper (Free trial, $60 license - professional features)

PAID:
- Adobe Audition ($20/mo - industry standard, audio editing focused)
- Pro Tools ($30/mo - industry standard, music/VO)
- Logic Pro ($200 one-time, Mac only)

RECORDING SETTINGS:
- Sample rate: 48 kHz (industry standard, broadcast)
- Bit depth: 24-bit (more dynamic range)
- Format: WAV (uncompressed, high quality)

---

POST-PROCESSING:

EDITING:
1. Remove mistakes, mouth clicks, breaths (if excessive)
2. Select best takes (if multiple)
3. Trim silence (beginning, end)

NOISE REDUCTION:
- Record room tone (30 sec silence)
- Apply noise reduction (capture noise profile, reduce)
- Don't over-reduce (sounds robotic)

EQ (Equalization):
- High-pass filter (remove low rumble, <80 Hz)
- Boost presence (2-5 kHz, clarity, articulation)
- Reduce harshness (if sibilant, reduce 6-8 kHz)

COMPRESSION:
- Even out volume (loud parts quieter, quiet parts louder)
- Ratio: 3:1 to 6:1 (moderate compression)
- Threshold: -20 dB to -10 dB
- Attack: Fast (10-30 ms)
- Release: Medium (100-300 ms)

NORMALIZATION:
- Raise overall volume (peak at -3 dB to -1 dB)
- Don't clip (red, distorted)

EXPORT:
- Format: WAV (uncompressed) or MP3 (if file size limit)
- Bit rate (if MP3): 320 kbps (highest quality)
- Mono (most VO, not stereo)
