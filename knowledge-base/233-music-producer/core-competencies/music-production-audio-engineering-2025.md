DAW BASICS:

AUDIO vs MIDI:
- Audio: Recorded sound (wav, mp3), waveform, destructive editing
- MIDI: Musical instructions (note, velocity, pitch, duration), not sound, non-destructive, can change instrument

TRACKS:
- Audio track: Record vocals, guitar, live instruments
- MIDI track: Virtual instruments (synthesizers, drums, piano)
- Instrument track: MIDI + instrument (combined)
- Bus/Group track: Combine multiple tracks (drum bus, vocal bus)

ARRANGEMENT:
- Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Outro (song structure)
- 4/8/16 bar sections (common dance music)
- 32 bar verse, 16 bar chorus (common pop)

TEMPO & KEY:
- BPM (Beats Per Minute): 70-90 (slow, ballad), 100-130 (mid, pop/rock), 128-140 (fast, EDM/dance)
- Key: C Major (no sharps/flats, easiest), determine key from vocal/melody

## Music Production Workflow

```markdown
SONGWRITING & ARRANGEMENT:

1. IDEA GENERATION:
   - Melody first: Hum, sing, record (voice memos, then transpose to MIDI)
   - Chords first: Play chords (guitar, piano), find progression
   - Drums first: Lay beat, build around groove
   - Sample-based: Chop samples, build from existing audio

2. CHORD PROGRESSIONS (Common, proven):
   - I-V-vi-IV (C-G-Am-F): Extremely popular (Let It Be, Don't Stop Believin', With or Without You)
   - vi-IV-I-V (Am-F-C-G): Slightly sadder (Apologize, Grenade)
   - I-vi-IV-V (C-Am-F-G): 50s progression (Stand By Me, Every Breath You Take)
   - I-IV-V (C-F-G): Blues, rock (Twist and Shout, La Bamba)
   - ii-V-I (Dm-G-C): Jazz standard

3. MELODY:
   - Start on root, third, or fifth of chord (stable, consonant)
   - Stepwise motion (conjunct, move by one note) vs leaps (disjunct, bigger intervals)
   - Contour: Rising (energy, excitement), falling (resolution, calm), arch (tension → release)
   - Rhythm: Syncopation (off-beat, groove), anticipation (come in early)

4. ARRANGEMENT (Instrument choice, layering):
   - LOW END (Sub-bass, bass): One element (kick, bass, sub, not all competing)
   - MIDS (Chords, pads, guitars): Harmonic support, texture
   - HIGH END (Melody, vocals, leads, hi-hats): Attention, clarity
   - SPACE: Don't fill every frequency (leave room, dynamic contrast)

RECORDING:

MICROPHONE PLACEMENT:
- Vocals:
  * Large diaphragm condenser (Neumann U87, Audio-Technica AT2020, Rode NT1)
  * 6-12 inches from mouth, pop filter, angle slightly off-axis (reduce plosives)
  * Cardioid pattern (reject sides/back, focus front)
- Acoustic guitar:
  * Point mic at 12th fret (balanced, not too boomy or bright)
  * Stereo: Two mics (XY, spaced pair, capture width)
- Electric guitar:
  * Dynamic mic (Shure SM57) on amp speaker, 1 inch away, on-axis (bright) or off-axis (darker)
- Drums:
  * Kick: Inside drum (SM91, Beta 91A) or outside (D112, Beta 52A)
  * Snare: SM57 (top), AKG 451 (bottom, for snare wires)
  * Overheads: Condenser pair (capture cymbals, room)

GAIN STAGING:
- Input gain: Peak around -12 to -6 dB (headroom, not clipping)
- Track faders: Start at unity (0 dB, don't compensate with fader, fix at source)
- Record 24-bit (more dynamic range than 16-bit, 44.1kHz or 48kHz sample rate)

COMPING (Compile best takes):
- Record multiple takes (vocals, solos)
- Comp: Select best parts from each (phrase-by-phrase)
- Crossfade between selections (smooth transitions)

---

SOUND DESIGN (Synthesizers):

SUBTRACTIVE SYNTHESIS (Most common):
- Oscillator: Generate sound (waveforms)
  * Sine: Pure tone (sub-bass, no harmonics)
  * Saw: Bright, harsh (synth leads, basses, rich harmonics)
  * Square: Hollow, video game (chiptune, retro sounds)
  * Triangle: Soft, flute-like (pads, mellow leads)
- Filter: Remove frequencies
  * Low-pass: Remove highs (warm, mellow), most common
  * High-pass: Remove lows (thin, airy)
  * Band-pass: Keep middle range (telephone effect)
  * Resonance: Boost at cutoff frequency (emphasis, character)
- Envelope (ADSR):
  * Attack: Time to reach max volume (0ms = immediate, pluck; 500ms = slow, pad)
  * Decay: Time to drop to sustain level
  * Sustain: Level held while note pressed
  * Release: Time to silence after note released
- LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator): Modulate parameters (vibrato, wobble)
  * Rate: Speed of modulation
  * Depth: Amount of modulation
  * Common: LFO → Filter cutoff (wobble bass)

SYNTH PLUGINS:
- Serum (Xfer): Wavetable, visual (see waveform), EDM standard
- Vital (Free): Similar to Serum, free, powerful
- Massive X (Native Instruments): Wavetable, complex modulation
- Omnisphere (Spectrasonics): Huge library, cinematic, expensive ($500)

## Mixing

```markdown
MIXING FUNDAMENTALS:

BALANCE (Volume, panning):
- Start with faders at -∞ (silence)
- Bring in kick, bass (foundation)
- Add drums (snare, hi-hats)
- Add melodic elements (vocals, guitars, keys)
- Panning: Center (kick, bass, lead vocal, snare), sides (guitars, keys, background vocals, hi-hats)
  * LCR panning (Left-Center-Right, nothing in between, clear separation)
  * Stereo width: Pan similar elements opposite (guitar L, guitar R)

EQ (Equalization, shape frequency content):
- HIGH-PASS FILTER (Cut lows):
  * Everything except kick, bass, sub: 80-120 Hz (remove rumble, mud)
  * Vocals: 100 Hz
  * Guitars: 80 Hz
  * Keys: 100 Hz
- SUBTRACTIVE (Cut bad frequencies):
  * Mud (200-500 Hz): Too much = boxy, muffled (cut 1-3 dB)
  * Harshness (2-4 kHz): Too much = piercing (cut 1-2 dB)
- ADDITIVE (Boost good frequencies):
  * Presence (2-5 kHz): Clarity, articulation (vocals, guitars, +1-3 dB)
  * Air (10-15 kHz): Sparkle, openness (vocals, cymbals, +1-2 dB)
- PARAMETRIC EQ: Q (width), Gain (amount), Frequency (where)
  * Narrow Q (2-5): Surgical cuts (remove resonance, ring)
  * Wide Q (0.5-1.5): Musical boosts/cuts (gentle shaping)

COMPRESSION (Control dynamics, even out volume):
- Threshold: Level where compression starts (-20 dB to -10 dB)
- Ratio: Amount of compression (4:1 = medium, 8:1 = heavy, 20:1 = limiting)
- Attack: How fast compressor responds (fast = tight, controlled; slow = preserve transients, punch)
  * Drums: Fast attack (2-10 ms, control peaks)
  * Vocals: Medium attack (10-30 ms, natural)
- Release: How fast compressor stops (fast = pumping, breathing; slow = smooth, transparent)
  * Auto-release: Compressor adjusts (most natural)
- Makeup gain: Bring level back up after compression
- Knee: Hard (abrupt), soft (gradual, more musical)

REVERB (Space, depth):
- Types:
  * Room: Small, intimate (vocals, acoustic guitar)
  * Hall: Large, concert hall (orchestral, cinematic)
  * Plate: Bright, smooth (vocals, snare, classic)
  * Spring: Vintage, guitar amps (surf rock, rockabilly)
- Parameters:
  * Decay time: How long reverb lasts (1-2 sec = short, 3-5 sec = long)
  * Pre-delay: Gap before reverb (20-50 ms, separation from dry signal, clarity)
  * Mix (Wet/Dry): 10-30% wet (subtle), 50%+ (ambient, dreamy)
- Send/Return: Reverb on bus (send tracks to reverb, control send amount, saves CPU)

DELAY (Echo, rhythm):
- Types:
  * Slapback: Short (50-150 ms), rockabilly, vocals
  * Eighth-note: Rhythmic (sync to tempo, 1/8 note), common
  * Ping-pong: Bounces L-R (stereo width)
- Parameters:
  * Time: Delay length (ms or synced to tempo)
  * Feedback: Number of repeats (low = 1-2 repeats, high = infinite)
  * Mix: 20-40% (blend with dry signal)

MIXING PROCESS:

1. ORGANIZE:
   - Color-code tracks (drums red, vocals blue, guitars green)
   - Group/bus (drum bus, vocal bus, instrument bus)
   - Hide unused tracks

2. GAIN STAGING:
   - All tracks peak around -12 to -6 dB (headroom)
   - Master fader at 0 dB, peaking around -6 dB (leave headroom for mastering)

3. BALANCE (Rough mix):
   - Faders only (no EQ, compression, effects yet)
   - Get relative volumes right (vocals audible, kick punchy, not too loud)

4. EQ (Clean up, shape):
   - High-pass filter (remove rumble)
   - Cut problem frequencies (mud, harshness, resonances)
   - Boost good frequencies (presence, air, sparingly)

5. COMPRESSION (Dynamics):
   - Vocals: 3:1 to 6:1, medium attack/release, 3-6 dB gain reduction
   - Drums: Fast attack, medium release, 5-10 dB gain reduction (punch)
   - Bass: 4:1, medium attack, auto-release, 3-5 dB reduction (consistency)

6. EFFECTS (Space, depth):
   - Reverb (depth, send 10-30%)
   - Delay (width, rhythm, send 20-40%)
   - Modulation (chorus, flanger, phaser, subtle movement)

7. AUTOMATION (Movement):
   - Volume rides (vocals louder in chorus, quieter in verse)
   - Effect sends (more reverb on vocal endings)
   - Panning (subtle movement, interest)

8. REFERENCE:
   - Compare to professional tracks (similar genre, sound)
   - Match loudness (turn reference down, or your mix up, A/B)
   - Note differences (brighter, more bass, wider, etc.), adjust

## Mastering

```markdown
MASTERING (Final polish, loudness, distribution-ready):

GOALS:
- Cohesive (album sounds consistent, track-to-track)
- Loud (competitive with commercial releases, but not squashed)
- Translates (sounds good on all systems: car, phone, club, headphones)

PROCESS:

1. START WITH GOOD MIX:
   - Peak at -6 dB (headroom for mastering processing)
   - Don't over-compress or over-limit mix (mastering engineer needs dynamic range)

2. EQ (Subtle, broad):
   - High-pass: 20-30 Hz (remove sub-rumble, nothing audible here)
   - Low shelf: Boost/cut below 100 Hz (add warmth or reduce muddiness, ±1 dB)
   - High shelf: Boost/cut above 10 kHz (add air or reduce harshness, ±1 dB)
   - Narrow cuts: Remove resonances (subtle, surgical)

3. COMPRESSION (Glue, cohesion):
   - Gentle (1.5:1 to 2:1 ratio, slow attack, auto-release)
   - 1-3 dB gain reduction (subtle, hold mix together)

4. MULTIBAND COMPRESSION (Frequency-specific dynamics):
   - Control lows (prevent boomy bass, tight)
   - Control highs (prevent harsh sibilance)
   - iZotope Ozone, FabFilter Pro-MB

5. STEREO WIDENING (Optional):
   - Widen sides (more spacious, careful not to lose mono compatibility)
   - Mid/Side EQ: Boost highs on sides (air), cut lows on sides (keep bass centered)

6. LIMITING (Loudness):
   - Increase overall volume (brick-wall limiter, no peaks above 0 dB)
   - Target: -14 LUFS (streaming standard, Spotify, Apple Music)
   - -8 to -6 LUFS (louder, competitive with EDM/pop, but less dynamic)
   - True peak: -1 dBTP (prevent inter-sample peaks, clipping on converters)

7. DITHERING:
   - If exporting to 16-bit (CD, most streaming, from 24-bit or 32-bit float)
   - Adds subtle noise (prevents quantization distortion)
   - Export at 44.1 kHz, 16-bit, dithered (final master)

---

LOUDNESS STANDARDS:

SPOTIFY: -14 LUFS (if louder, turns down; if quieter, leaves as is)
APPLE MUSIC: -16 LUFS (similar to Spotify)
YOUTUBE: -13 LUFS
SOUNDCLOUD: -8 to -13 LUFS (no normalization, louder = better, but dynamic range suffers)

LOUDNESS WAR:
- Trend: Make tracks as loud as possible (compete for attention)
- Problem: Over-compressed, no dynamics (fatiguing to listen)
- Solution: Master for streaming (-14 LUFS, preserve dynamics)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Arrangement first** - Great production starts with great song (chords, melody, structure)
2. **Less is more** - Don't over-process (subtle EQ/compression > heavy, every track doesn't need everything)
3. **Reference tracks** - Compare to pros (learn what "finished" sounds like)
4. **Ears, not eyes** - Trust ears (not just meters, visual waveforms)
5. **Take breaks** - Ear fatigue (rest every hour, come back fresh)
