---

## Instagram Strategy

```markdown
ALGORITHM FACTORS (2025):

1. ENGAGEMENT (Most important):
   - Likes, comments, shares, saves
   - Shares > Saves > Comments > Likes (value hierarchy)

2. RELEVANCE:
   - Similar to content user engaged with before
   - Hashtags, captions

3. RECENCY:
   - Newer posts prioritized
   - But engagement matters more than timing

4. RELATIONSHIPS:
   - Accounts user interacts with frequently
   - DMs, comments, profile visits

---

POST TYPES:

FEED POST (Photo):
- Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square) or 4:5 (portrait)
- Carousel (swipe) gets 1.4x more engagement
- Use all 10 slides (mini-guide, storytelling)

REEL (Video):
- Duration: 15-90 seconds (sweet spot: 30-45 sec)
- Vertical (9:16)
- Hook in first 3 seconds!
- Use trending audio (explore → audio)
- Captions (80% watch muted)

STORY:
- 24-hour lifespan
- Interactive stickers (polls, questions, quizzes)
- Drive DM engagement
- Swipe-up links (10K+ followers or verified)

---

HASHTAG STRATEGY:

Use 20-30 hashtags (don't spam):

MIX:
- 5 high-volume (#fitness 50M posts)
- 15 medium-volume (#fitnesstips 500K posts)
- 10 niche (#hiitworkout 50K posts)

RESEARCH:
- Check competitors' hashtags
- Use Instagram search (see post count)
- Avoid banned hashtags (check)

PLACEMENT:
- In caption (not just first comment)
- Group by relevance
- Create branded hashtag (#YourBrandChallenge)

---

CAPTION WRITING:

STRUCTURE:
1. HOOK (First line - shows in feed)
   "This workout mistake is sabotaging your gains 👇"

2. VALUE (Main content)
   Explain, teach, entertain

3. CALL-TO-ACTION (End)
   "Save this for later! 💾"
   "Tag a friend who needs to see this 👇"
   "What's your favorite exercise? Comment below! 💬"

LENGTH:
- Short (1-2 sentences): Quick consumption
- Long (200+ words): Storytelling, education
- Test both!

VOICE:
- Authentic (like talking to friend)
- Emojis (adds personality, but don't overdo)
- Line breaks (readability)
```

---

## TikTok Strategy

```markdown
ALGORITHM (For You Page):

1. VIDEO COMPLETION RATE:
   - Do users watch entire video?
   - Hook in first 1 second!
   - Shorter videos (15-30 sec) = higher completion

2. ENGAGEMENT:
   - Likes, comments, shares
   - Shares especially important (viral signal)

3. RE-WATCHES:
   - Users watch multiple times
   - Make last frame connect to first (loop)

4. WATCH TIME:
   - Total minutes watched (not just % completion)

---

CONTENT FORMULA:

HOOK (0-3 seconds):
- Text overlay: "POV: You just started your business"
- Visual: Something unexpected happens
- Voiceover: "Wait for it..."

BODY (3-25 seconds):
- Deliver on hook promise
- Value, entertainment, or both
- Keep pacing fast (cut every 2-3 seconds)

CTA (25-30 seconds):
- "Follow for more tips!"
- "Part 2 in my profile"
- "Comment 'yes' for the template"

---

TRENDING SOUNDS:

Find:
- For You Page (audio icon → "Add to Favorites")
- Creative Center (ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter)
- Competitors' top videos

Use within 7 days (peak virality window)

ORIGINAL AUDIO:
- Can go viral if catchy
- Others can use it (free promotion)
- But trending sounds usually perform better initially

---

TIKTOK SEO:

TikTok = Search engine (40% Gen Z use for search!)

OPTIMIZE:
- Caption: Include keywords naturally
- Hashtags: 3-5 relevant (#LearnOnTikTok)
- On-screen text: Keywords visible
- Voiceover: TikTok transcribes audio

Example:
Topic: "How to create TikTok content"
Caption: "3 easy ways to create TikTok content fast #TikTokTips #ContentCreator #SocialMediaMarketing"
```

---

## LinkedIn Strategy

```markdown
CONTENT TYPES:

TEXT POST:
- No link (algorithm deprioritizes links)
- 1,300-2,000 characters (full article in post)
- Personal story + business lesson
- Works well for thought leadership

CAROUSEL:
- PDF with 5-10 slides
- Swipe format (like Instagram)
- Educational (tips, guides, lists)
- High engagement

VIDEO:
- Native upload (not YouTube link)
- 1-3 minutes
- Captions (most watch muted)
- Talking head or screen recording

ARTICLE:
- Long-form (500+ words)
- Publish directly on LinkedIn
- Good for SEO (Google indexes)

POLL:
- 2-4 options
- Simple, relevant question
- Drives engagement (easy to click)

---

POSTING STRATEGY:

POST STRUCTURE:
1. HOOK (First 2 lines visible)
   "I made $100K in 6 months with LinkedIn."

2. STORY (Personal experience)
   "Here's what I learned..."

3. VALUE (Actionable tips)
   "3 strategies that worked:"

4. CTA (Engagement)
   "What's worked for you? Comment below 👇"

ENGAGEMENT BAIT (Use sparingly):
- "Agree? Comment YES"
- "Save this for later 💾"
- "Repost if you found this helpful ♻️"

COMMENT REPLIES:
- Reply to every comment (first hour critical)
- Ask follow-up questions (boost engagement)
- LinkedIn prioritizes posts with active conversations

---

LINKEDIN ALGORITHM:

ENGAGEMENT WINDOW: First hour critical
- DM 10-20 connections "New post! Check it out"
- Ask them to engage (like, comment)
- Algorithm sees early engagement → Boosts post

DWELL TIME:
- How long users spend reading
- Longer posts = higher dwell time
- Algorithm rewards

RELEVANCE:
- Based on profile keywords, hashtags
- LinkedIn analyzes your content (use keywords naturally)
```
