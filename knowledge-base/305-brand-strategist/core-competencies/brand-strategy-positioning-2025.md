## Brand Strategy Fundamentals

```markdown
BRAND DEFINITION:

BRAND ≠ LOGO
- Brand = Perception in customer's mind
- Logo = Visual representation

BRAND ELEMENTS:
- Name (Apple, Nike, Tesla)
- Logo, colors, fonts
- Messaging (taglines, voice)
- Experience (every touchpoint)
- Reputation (what people say about you)

BRAND EQUITY:
- Financial value of brand
- Example: Coca-Cola brand worth $80B (more than physical assets)
- Drivers:
  * Awareness (do people know you?)
  * Associations (what do they think of you?)
  * Loyalty (will they choose you again?)
  * Perceived quality (is it worth the price?)

---

BRAND PYRAMID (Keller Model):

TIER 5 (Top): RESONANCE
- Deep bond with brand
- Active engagement (buy repeatedly, recommend)
- Example: Apple fans camp out for new iPhone

TIER 4: JUDGMENTS & FEELINGS
- Judgments: Quality, credibility, superiority
- Feelings: Fun, excitement, security, social approval
- Example: Volvo = safety

TIER 3: RESPONSE
- Brand performance (how well does product work?)
- Brand imagery (who uses it? what does it say about me?)
- Example: Rolex = luxury, status

TIER 2: MEANING
- Attributes, benefits
- Example: Nike = performance, innovation

TIER 1 (Base): IDENTITY/SALIENCE
- Brand awareness
- Can you recall/recognize it?
- Top-of-mind awareness (first brand you think of)
```

## Brand Positioning

```markdown
POSITIONING STATEMENT:

FORMAT:
For [target audience]
Who [need/opportunity]
[Brand] is a [category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [competitors]
[Brand] [reason to believe]

EXAMPLE (Airbnb):
For travelers
Who want authentic local experiences
Airbnb is a home-sharing platform
That connects you with unique homes and hosts
Unlike hotels that offer standardized rooms
Airbnb provides personal, local stays

---

POSITIONING STRATEGIES:

1. ATTRIBUTE-BASED:
   - Volvo = Safety
   - BMW = Performance ("Ultimate Driving Machine")
   - FedEx = Reliability ("When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight")

2. BENEFIT-BASED:
   - Head & Shoulders = Dandruff-free
   - Sensodyne = Sensitivity relief
   - Minute Maid = Convenient (vs fresh-squeezed)

3. USE/APPLICATION:
   - Gatorade = Sports hydration
   - Red Bull = Energy for extreme activities
   - Slack = Team communication

4. USER-BASED:
   - Harley-Davidson = Rebels, freedom-seekers
   - Lululemon = Yoga enthusiasts
   - Tesla = Early adopters, environmentalists

5. COMPETITOR-BASED:
   - Avis = "We're #2, so we try harder"
   - 7UP = "The Uncola"
   - Mac = "I'm a Mac" vs "I'm a PC"

6. QUALITY/PRICE:
   - Ritz-Carlton = Luxury, premium
   - Dollar Shave Club = Affordable, no-frills
   - IKEA = Affordable design

---

DIFFERENTIATION (Porter):

3 STRATEGIES:

COST LEADERSHIP:
- Lowest price
- Examples: Walmart, Southwest Airlines, IKEA
- Risk: Race to bottom, low margins

DIFFERENTIATION:
- Unique value
- Examples: Apple (design), Volvo (safety), Patagonia (sustainability)
- Risk: Higher price, smaller market

FOCUS (Niche):
- Serve specific segment extremely well
- Examples: Peloton (home fitness), Lush (handmade cosmetics)
- Risk: Limited growth potential

STUCK IN THE MIDDLE:
- Neither cheapest nor most differentiated
- Weak position (avoid!)

---

PERCEPTUAL MAP:

AXES: Price (Low-High) × Quality (Low-High)

High Quality
     │
     │  Premium        Luxury
     │  (Nordstrom)    (Gucci)
     │
─────┼─────────────────────────── High Price
     │
     │  Value          Mid-tier
     │  (Target)       (Macy's)
     │
Low Quality

GOAL: Occupy unique space (not crowded)
```

## Brand Architecture

```markdown
TYPES:

1. BRANDED HOUSE:
   - Master brand on all products
   - Example: Virgin (Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Mobile, Virgin Galactic)
   - Pro: Brand equity transfers
   - Con: Risk spreads (one failure hurts all)

2. HOUSE OF BRANDS:
   - Individual brands, no master brand visible
   - Example: P&G (Tide, Pampers, Gillette)
   - Pro: Failures contained
   - Con: Expensive (build equity for each)

3. ENDORSED BRANDS:
   - Sub-brands endorsed by master brand
   - Example: Marriott (Courtyard by Marriott, Residence Inn by Marriott)
   - Pro: Credibility + flexibility
   - Con: Complexity

4. HYBRID:
   - Mix of strategies
   - Example: Coca-Cola (Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, Dasani)

---

PORTFOLIO ROLES:

FLAGSHIP:
- Core offering
- Highest revenue
- Example: iPhone for Apple

FLANKER:
- Protect market share
- Combat competitors
- Example: Diet Coke (response to Diet Pepsi)

CASH COW:
- Mature product
- Low growth, high profit
- Milk it, don't invest heavily
- Example: Tide (detergent)

HIGH-END PRESTIGE:
- Premium product
- Elevates brand perception
- Example: Tesla Roadster (halo effect for Model 3)

ENTRY-LEVEL:
- Low price, acquire customers
- Upsell later
- Example: Adobe Photoshop Elements → Creative Cloud
```

## Brand Messaging

```markdown
MESSAGING HIERARCHY:

BRAND VISION:
- Aspirational
- Long-term (10-30 years)
- Example: Tesla: "Accelerate world's transition to sustainable energy"

BRAND MISSION:
- What you do, who you serve
- Example: Patagonia: "Build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use business to protect nature"

BRAND VALUES:
- Beliefs, principles
- Example: Nike: Performance, Innovation, Inspiration, Sustainability

VALUE PROPOSITION:
- What you offer, why it matters
- Example: Slack: "Be more productive at work with less effort"

TAGLINE:
- Short, memorable
- Examples:
  * Nike: "Just Do It"
  * Apple: "Think Different"
  * L'Oréal: "Because You're Worth It"
  * BMW: "The Ultimate Driving Machine"

KEY MESSAGES:
- 3-5 main points
- Example (Zoom):
  * Easy to use (1-click join)
  * Reliable (99.9% uptime)
  * Affordable ($14.99/month)

PROOF POINTS:
- Evidence supporting messages
- Example: "Rated #1 by Gartner" (credibility)

---

BRAND VOICE:

TONE:
- Friendly vs Professional
- Playful vs Serious
- Casual vs Formal

EXAMPLES:

MAILCHIMP:
- Friendly, quirky, approachable
- "Send better email"
- Chimp mascot (playful)

GOLDMAN SACHS:
- Professional, authoritative, serious
- "Progress is everyone's business"
- Navy blue, conservative

WENDY'S:
- Sassy, bold, funny
- Twitter roasts competitors
- "Where's the beef?"

INNOCENT (Smoothies):
- Innocent, pure, childlike
- "Tastes good, does good"
- Lowercase font, hand-drawn

---

STORYTELLING:

STORY ARC:
1. Hero (customer, not brand!)
2. Problem (challenge they face)
3. Guide (brand helps)
4. Plan (how to solve)
5. Action (call to action)
6. Success (transformation)

EXAMPLE (Apple "1984" ad):
1. Hero: You (viewer)
2. Problem: Conformity (Big Brother)
3. Guide: Apple Macintosh
4. Plan: Buy a Mac
5. Action: "On Jan 24, Apple will introduce Macintosh"
6. Success: "You'll see why 1984 won't be like '1984'"

BRAND NARRATIVE:
- Origin story (why we started)
- Mission (what we're trying to do)
- Values (what we stand for)
- Impact (change we're making)

EMOTIONAL CONNECTION:
- Facts tell, stories sell
- Make customer the hero (not your product)
```

   - Market trends (what's changing?)

3. GAP ANALYSIS:
   - Intended brand (what we want to be) vs Perceived brand (what customers think)

4. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Rebrand? (major overhaul)
   - Refresh? (modernize, tweak)
   - Reposition? (change target or messaging)
   - Do nothing? (brand is strong)

---

```

---

## Rebranding

```markdown
WHEN TO REBRAND:

NECESSARY:
- Merger/acquisition (two brands become one)
- Legal issue (trademark dispute, negative association)
- Outdated (irrelevant to modern audience)
- Geographic expansion (name doesn't translate)

RISKY:
- Bored with logo (not a good reason!)
- CEO's personal taste
- Following trends

FAMOUS REBRANDS:

SUCCESS:
- Old Spice (2010): Old → Young, hip
  * Campaign: "The Man Your Man Could Smell Like"
  * Result: 107% sales increase
- Burberry (2000s): Outdated → Modern luxury
  * Digital innovation, younger models
  * Result: Brand value doubled

FAILURE:
- Gap (2010): New logo, public outcry
  * Reverted after 6 days
  * Lesson: Don't fix what's not broken
- Tropicana (2009): Redesigned packaging
  * Sales dropped 20%
  * Reverted after 2 months
  * Lesson: Test with customers first

---
