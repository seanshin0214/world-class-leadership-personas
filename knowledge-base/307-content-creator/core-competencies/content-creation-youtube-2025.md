## Content Strategy

```markdown
NICHE SELECTION:

CRITERIA:
- Passion (can you create 100+ videos on this?)
- Knowledge (are you an expert or willing to learn?)
- Audience demand (people searching for this?)
- Competition (oversaturated or opportunity?)
- Monetization potential (ads, sponsorships, products?)

EXAMPLES:
- Tech reviews (high CPM $10-20, competitive)
- Personal finance (high CPM $8-15, evergreen)
- Gaming (low CPM $2-5, huge audience)
- Education (medium CPM $5-10, sponsorship potential)
- Vlogging (medium CPM $3-8, broad appeal)

NICHE-DOWN:
❌ "Fitness" (too broad)
✅ "Home workouts for busy moms" (specific)

❌ "Cooking" (too broad)
✅ "Quick meals under 15 minutes" (specific)

---

CONTENT PILLARS (3-5 types of content):

EXAMPLE (Tech channel):
1. Reviews (product deep dives)
2. Tutorials (how-to guides)
3. News (weekly roundup)
4. Comparisons (iPhone vs Samsung)
5. Tips & tricks (hidden features)

BENEFIT:
- Variety (don't get bored)
- Attract different audiences (some want reviews, others tutorials)
- Consistent upload schedule (rotate pillars)

---

CONTENT IDEAS:

TOOLS:
- YouTube Search (start typing, see autocomplete suggestions)
- Google Trends (what's trending?)
- AnswerThePublic (questions people ask)
- TubeBuddy, VidIQ (keyword research)
- Competitor channels (what's working for them?)

FORMATS:
- How-to (solve a problem)
- Listicles ("Top 10 X")
- Reaction videos
- Challenges
- Behind-the-scenes
- Q&A (audience engagement)
- Collaborations (cross-promotion)
```

## Video Production

```markdown
EQUIPMENT:

BUDGET ($300):
- Camera: Smartphone (iPhone 13+, Samsung S21+) $0 (already have)
- Microphone: Rode VideoMicro $60
- Lighting: Neewer Ring Light $40
- Tripod: AmazonBasics $25
- Editing software: DaVinci Resolve (free)

MID-TIER ($1,000):
- Camera: Sony ZV-1 $700
- Microphone: Rode Wireless GO II $300

- Lighting: Aputure 300d II $650
- Tripod: Manfrotto 504X $500

PRIORITY: Audio > Lighting > Camera
- Bad audio = people leave immediately
- Good lighting = cheap camera looks great
- Camera matters least (smartphone is fine)

---

FILMING:

LIGHTING:
- Three-point lighting:
  * Key light (main, 45° to side)
  * Fill light (opposite side, softer)
  * Backlight (behind subject, separation from background)
- Natural light: Face window (indirect, diffused)

FRAMING:
- Rule of thirds (eyes on top third line)
- Headroom (small gap above head, not too much)
- Eye level (camera at eye height, not looking down)
- Background (clean, not distracting)

AUDIO:
- Quiet room (turn off AC, close windows)
- Mic close to mouth (6-12 inches)
- Test audio (check levels before full take)
- Backup audio (record on phone too)

---

EDITING:

SOFTWARE:
- Free: DaVinci Resolve, CapCut
- Paid: Adobe Premiere Pro ($23/mo), Final Cut Pro ($300 one-time)

PROCESS:
1. Import footage
2. Cut out mistakes, pauses, "ums"
3. Add B-roll (cutaways: product shots, screen recordings)
4. Add music (YouTube Audio Library, Epidemic Sound)
5. Add text (titles, key points, subtitles)
6. Color grade (adjust brightness, contrast, saturation)
7. Export (1080p H.264, 8-10 Mbps)

PACING:
- Cut aggressively (no dead air)
- Jump cuts (every 3-10 seconds)
- Hooks every 15-30 seconds (keep attention)
- Vary shots (close-up, wide, B-roll)

THUMBNAILS:
- High contrast (bright colors)
- Readable text (3-5 words, 50+ font size)
- Close-up face (expressive, emotion)
- 1280×720px (16:9 ratio)
- Tools: Canva, Photoshop, Figma
```

## YouTube Algorithm

```markdown
HOW IT WORKS:

1. CLICK-THROUGH RATE (CTR):
   - % of impressions that become clicks
   - Thumbnail + title must grab attention
   - Good CTR: 4-10% (varies by niche)

2. AVERAGE VIEW DURATION (AVD):
   - How long people watch (not just % watched)
   - 10 min video, 5 min AVD = 50%
   - 5 min video, 3 min AVD = 60% but less total watch time
   - YouTube prefers absolute watch time

3. ENGAGEMENT:
   - Likes, comments, shares
   - Signals video is valuable
   - Encourages discussion in comments

4. CONSISTENCY:
   - Upload schedule (weekly, 2×/week, daily)
   - Algorithm rewards regular uploaders
   - Keeps audience trained to expect content

---

OPTIMIZATION:

TITLE:
- Front-load keywords (first 50 characters)
- Curiosity gap ("This changed everything")
- Numbers ("7 tips", "Increased by 300%")
- Brackets [increase CTR 33%]

EXAMPLES:
✅ "iPhone 15 Review: 5 Things Apple Won't Tell You [2025]"
✅ "I Tried Keto for 30 Days - Here's What Happened"
❌ "My new phone review" (vague, no keywords)

DESCRIPTION:
- First 150 characters (shown before "Show More")
- Include keywords naturally
- Timestamps (chapters - boosts retention)
- Links (affiliate, social media, website)

TAGS:
- Less important than before (2-3% of ranking)
- Use: Exact video topic, channel name, common misspellings

CARDS & END SCREENS:
- Cards: Mid-video links (related videos, playlists)
- End screens: Last 5-20 seconds (next video, subscribe)

---

HOOKS (First 8 seconds):

BAD:
❌ "Hey guys, welcome back to my channel. Today we're going to talk about..."
(Loses attention immediately)

GOOD:
✅ "This app saved me 10 hours per week. Here's how."
(Curiosity + benefit)

✅ "I spent $5,000 on this camera. Was it worth it?"
(High stakes + question)

FORMATS:
- Tease result ("By the end, you'll know...")
- Pose problem ("Struggling with X?")
- Controversial statement ("Everyone is wrong about...")
- Story hook ("Last week, something crazy happened...")

---

RETENTION:

PATTERN INTERRUPTS (every 30 seconds):
- B-roll (cut to different shot)
- Text overlay (emphasize key points)
- Sound effect (whoosh, ding)
- Zoom in/out (dynamic movement)
- Music change (build tension)

PACING:
- Vary shot duration (don't linger)
- Cut during breaths (tighten pacing)
- No long explanations (break into chunks)

PAYOFFS:
- Deliver on promise (don't clickbait)
- Multiple payoffs (not just at end)
- Unexpected value (bonus tips)
```
