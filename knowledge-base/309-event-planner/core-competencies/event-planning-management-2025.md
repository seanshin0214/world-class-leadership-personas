## Event Planning Process

```markdown
PHASES:

1. DISCOVERY (Initial meeting):
   - Client's vision (what do they want?)
   - Event type (wedding, conference, gala, product launch)
   - Date & time (flexible or fixed?)
   - Guest count (50, 200, 1,000?)
   - Budget (realistic range)
   - Must-haves vs Nice-to-haves

2. CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT:
   - Theme (if applicable)
   - Mood board (colors, style, inspiration)
   - Floor plan (layout, seating)
   - Timeline (hour-by-hour schedule)
   - Budget breakdown

3. VENDOR SOURCING:
   - Venue (book first, limited availability)
   - Catering
   - Rentals (tables, chairs, linens, décor)
   - AV (audio, visual, lighting)
   - Entertainment (band, DJ, speakers)
   - Photography/videography
   - Florist
   - Transportation (shuttle, valet)

4. COORDINATION:
   - Confirm vendors (contracts, deposits)
   - Create timeline (detailed minute-by-minute)
   - Rehearsal (if needed: weddings, conferences with speakers)
   - Final walkthrough (1-2 days before)

5. EXECUTION (Event day):
   - On-site management (arrive early, stay late)
   - Vendor coordination (ensure setup on time)
   - Problem-solving (inevitable issues, stay calm)
   - Timeline management (keep on schedule)

6. WRAP-UP:
   - Vendor payments (final invoices)
   - Thank you notes
   - Post-event survey (client feedback)
   - Debrief (what went well, what to improve)
```

BUDGET BREAKDOWN (Corporate conference, $100K):

VENUE:
- Room rental: $10K (20%)
- AV equipment (projectors, screens, mics): $5K

- Breakfast: $15/person × 500 = $7.5K
- Lunch: $35/person × 500 = $17.5K
- Reception: $40/person × 500 = $20K
- Coffee breaks: $8/person × 500 = $4K
- Total F&B: $49K (49%)

SPEAKERS & ENTERTAINMENT:

---

COST-SAVING TIPS:

VENUE:
- Off-peak dates (weekdays, off-season): 20-40% discount
- Non-traditional venues (brewery, museum, warehouse): Cheaper than hotels

- Brunch/lunch vs Dinner: 30-50% cheaper

DÉCOR:
- DIY centerpieces
- Rent vs Buy (rent if one-time use)
- Seasonal flowers (in-season 50% cheaper)

---

PRICING MODELS (Event planner fees):

PERCENTAGE:
- 15-20% of total budget
- Example: $100K event × 15% = $15K fee
- Pro: Aligns planner's incentive (better event = higher fee)
- Con: Client may question if planner inflating costs

FLAT FEE:
- Fixed price for service
- $5K-$50K (based on event scope)
- Pro: Client knows total cost upfront
- Con: Scope creep (if client adds requests)

HOURLY:
- $50-$200/hour
- Track time (consultations, site visits, coordination)
- Pro: Fair for small events
- Con: Unpredictable total cost

HYBRID:
- Flat fee + hourly overage
- Example: $10K (covers 100 hours), $100/hr after

## Vendor Management

```markdown
CONTRACTS:

ESSENTIAL CLAUSES:
- Services provided (deliverables, scope)
- Payment terms (deposit, balance, due dates)
  * Typical: 50% deposit at signing, 50% 2 weeks before event
- Cancellation policy (refund terms, force majeure)
- Liability insurance (vendor carries insurance)
- Setup/breakdown times
- Overtime fees (if event runs late)

RED FLAGS:
- No written contract (verbal agreements fail)
- Full payment upfront (you lose leverage)
- No liability insurance (you're at risk)
- Vague deliverables ("we'll provide what's needed" - be specific!)

---

KEY VENDORS:

VENUE:
- Site visit (check layout, parking, restrooms, accessibility)
- Ask:
  * Capacity (seated, standing, max occupancy)
  * Catering restrictions (in-house only or outside caterer allowed?)
  * Included (tables, chairs, AV?)
  * Fees (security, cleaning, overtime)
  * Availability (ceremony + reception on-site?)

CATERING:
- Tasting (essential! Don't book without tasting)
- Ask:
  * Per-person price (includes service, taxes, gratuity?)
  * Staffing ratio (1 server per 20-30 guests)
  * Dietary accommodations (vegetarian, vegan, allergies)
  * Bar packages (consumption vs open bar)
  * Cake cutting fee (if bringing external dessert)

FLORIST:
- Show inspiration photos (Pinterest, Instagram)
- Ask:
  * Delivery & setup included?
  * Breakdown/removal (who takes flowers after?)
  * Seasonal flowers (cheaper, fresher)
  * Substitutions (if flower unavailable)

PHOTOGRAPHER:
- Review portfolio (style: candid, posed, photojournalistic?)
- Ask:
  * Hours covered (arrival to departure or specific timeframe?)
  * Deliverables (# photos, albums, prints)
  * Turnaround time (2-4 weeks typical)
  * Raw files included? (usually no, edited only)
  * Second shooter (recommended for large events)

DJ/BAND:
- See them live (or video of performance)
- Ask:
  * Playlist input (can you request songs?)
  * Equipment (sound system, lighting, backup gear)
  * Emcee duties (announcements, introductions)
  * Breaks (continuous music or breaks?)
  * Overtime rate

---

## Logistics & Timeline

```markdown
FLOOR PLAN:

CONSIDERATIONS:

## Crisis Management

```markdown
COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:

- Decision timeline: Make call 24-48 hours before (communicate to guests)

POWER OUTAGE:
- Prevention: Generator rental (outdoor venues, old buildings)
- Backup: Battery-powered lights, candles

FOOD SHORTAGE:
- Prevention: Order 10% extra (guests bring unexpected +1s)
- Solution: Stretch (serve smaller portions, offer alternatives)

MEDICAL EMERGENCY:
- Prevention: Know venue's first aid kit location, call 911
- Staff trained in CPR (have someone certified on-site)

INTOXICATED GUEST:
- Prevention: Responsible bartending (cut off if overserved)
- Solution: Call Uber/Lyft, don't let drive

---

2. **Vendor relationships** - Treat them well (repeat business, referrals, they'll save you in a crisis)
3. **Flexibility** - Plans change (stay calm, problem-solve)
4. **Buffer time** - Always add 10-15 min (things run late)
5. **Communication** - Overcommunicate with client & vendors (expectations, timeline, changes)
