```markdown
INSTAGRAM (Visual, lifestyle, younger audience):

DEMOGRAPHICS:
- 67% ages 18-29
- 47% ages 30-49
- Female-skewed (but balanced)

CONTENT TYPES:
- Feed posts (photos, carousels): Polished, curated
- Stories (24 hours): Behind-the-scenes, casual, polls
- Reels (<90 sec video): Trending audio, entertainment, education
- IGTV (long-form video): Deprecated, use Reels

BEST PRACTICES:
- Post frequency: 3-7× per week (feed), daily (stories)
- Optimal times: Lunch (11am-1pm), evening (7-9pm) weekdays
- Hashtags: 3-5 relevant (max 30, but spammy)
  * Mix: Branded (#YourBrand), niche (#VeganRecipes), broad (#Foodie)
- Captions: Hook first line (pre "more"), call-to-action (CTA)
- Engagement: Respond to comments within 1 hour (algorithm boost)

ALGORITHM:
- Prioritizes: Engagement (saves > shares > comments > likes)

## Analytics & Optimization

```markdown
KEY METRICS:

REACH:
- Impressions (total views)
- Reach (unique viewers)
- Follower growth (net new followers)

ENGAGEMENT:
- Engagement rate = (Likes + Comments + Shares) / Followers × 100%
  * 1-3% = Average
  * 3-6% = Good
  * 6%+ = Excellent
- Save rate (Instagram): Indicates value
- Share rate: Indicates resonance

CONVERSION:
- Click-through rate (CTR): Link clicks / impressions
- Conversion rate: Purchases / link clicks
- Cost per acquisition (CPA): Ad spend / conversions

---

PLATFORM ANALYTICS:

INSTAGRAM INSIGHTS (Business account):
- Accounts reached (how many saw your content)
- Accounts engaged (interacted)
- Top posts (by reach, engagement)
- Follower demographics (age, gender, location, active times)

TIKTOK ANALYTICS:
- Video views
- Profile views
- Follower growth
- Trending videos
- Traffic source (For You vs Following vs Hashtag)

YOUTUBE ANALYTICS:
- Watch time (hours)
- Average view duration (how much of video watched)
- Click-through rate (thumbnail impressions → clicks)
- Traffic sources (YouTube search, suggested, external)

---

A/B TESTING:

TEST VARIABLES:
- Posting time (morning vs evening)
- Caption length (short vs long)
- Hashtags (3 vs 10 vs 30)
- Content type (photo vs video vs carousel)
- Thumbnail (face vs text vs product)

METHOD:
1. Change ONE variable at a time
2. Post 2 versions (A vs B)
3. Measure (engagement rate, reach)
4. Repeat winner

EXAMPLE:
- Post 1: Caption 50 words, 5 hashtags → 2.5% engagement
- Post 2: Caption 50 words, 20 hashtags → 1.8% engagement
- Conclusion: Fewer hashtags better (for your account)

---

MONTHLY REPORT TEMPLATE:

```

## Community Management

```markdown
RESPONDING TO COMMENTS:

TIMING:
- First hour critical (algorithm boost)
- Aim: Respond to all comments within 24 hours

TONE:
- Friendly, human (not robotic)
- Use emojis (match brand voice)
- Answer questions (helpful)
- Thank for positive feedback

EXAMPLES:
- "Love this!" → "Thank you! 😊"
- "Where did you get that shirt?" → "It's from [Brand], link in bio!"
- "This doesn't work" → "Sorry to hear! Can you DM us details so we can help?"

---

HANDLING NEGATIVE COMMENTS:

RESPOND PUBLICLY (Show you care):
- "Thanks for the feedback. We're sorry you had this experience. Please DM us so we can make it right."

MOVE TO DM (Resolve privately):
- Avoid public argument
- Gather details, offer solution
- Follow up publicly ("Glad we could resolve this!")

DELETE/BLOCK (Rare):
- Spam (bots, scams)
- Hate speech, harassment
- Competitors (posting their links)
- Excessive profanity

---

ENGAGEMENT TACTICS:

ASK QUESTIONS:
- "What's your favorite...?"
- "A or B?"
- "Fill in the blank: I wish I could..."

POLLS (Instagram Stories):
- Quick, easy interaction
- Binary choice (This or That?)

TAG PROMPTS:
- "Tag someone who..."
- "Tag your partner in crime"
- (Don't overuse, feels spammy)

RESPOND TO DMs:
- Personalized (use their name)
- Quick replies (saved responses for FAQs)
- Don't ghost (builds loyalty)

---

INFLUENCER COLLABORATION:

TYPES:
- Nano (1K-10K followers): High engagement, affordable ($100-$500/post)
- Micro (10K-100K): Niche, trusted ($500-$5K)
- Macro (100K-1M): Broad reach ($5K-$50K+)
- Mega (1M+): Celebrity status ($50K-$500K+)

FINDING:
- Hashtags (search your niche)
- Influencer platforms (AspireIQ, Upfluence)
- Engage first (comment, DM, build relationship)

OUTREACH:
- Personalized (don't copy-paste)
- Value prop ("We love your content on X, want to collab?")
- Clear terms (deliverables, compensation, timeline)

EXAMPLE EMAIL:
> Hi [Name],
> 
> I love your content on [topic]! Your recent post on [specific post] really resonated with our brand.
> 
> We'd love to partner with you for [campaign]. We're offering [compensation: $500 or free product] for [deliverables: 1 feed post + 3 stories].
> 
> Interested? Let's chat!
> 
> [Your name]

---

CRISIS MANAGEMENT:

TYPES OF CRISES:
- Product issue (defect, recall)
- PR misstep (offensive post, controversy)
- Security breach (hacked account)
- Negative viral post (complaint goes viral)

RESPONSE PROTOCOL:
1. PAUSE posting (don't schedule auto-posts during crisis)
2. ASSESS situation (What happened? Who's affected?)
3. RESPOND quickly (within hours, not days)
   - Acknowledge issue
   - Take responsibility (if at fault)
   - Explain action plan ("We're investigating and will update within 24 hours")
4. MONITOR (track mentions, sentiment)
5. FOLLOW UP (resolution, lessons learned)

EXAMPLE:
> We're aware of the issue with [product]. We sincerely apologize and are working urgently to resolve this. All affected customers will receive [refund/replacement]. Updates to follow.

DON'T:
- Delete comments (Streisand effect, looks like cover-up)
- Argue with customers
- Go silent (silence = guilt)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Platform-specific** - What works on TikTok ≠ LinkedIn (adapt strategy)
2. **Consistency** - Post regularly (algorithm rewards, builds habit for audience)
3. **Engagement > Followers** - 1K engaged followers > 10K ghosts (quality over quantity)
4. **Test & iterate** - A/B test, analyze, optimize (data-driven decisions)
5. **Authentic** - Be human (people connect with people, not logos)
