## Content Strategy

```markdown
NICHE SELECTION:

CRITERIA:
- Passion (can create 100+ videos on this?)
- Knowledge/skill (teach something, or learn publicly)
- Demand (people searching/watching this content?)
- Competition (not too saturated, or unique angle?)
- Monetization potential (ads, sponsors, products?)

EXAMPLES:
- Tech reviews (high CPM, sponsor-friendly)
- Personal finance (evergreen, affiliate opportunities)
- Fitness/nutrition (supplements, programs)
- Gaming (ads, memberships, merchandise)
- Education (courses, coaching)

AVOID:
- Too broad ("lifestyle" - what's your focus?)
- Too narrow (kayaking in Montana - tiny audience)
- Trend-chasing (fidget spinners - dies quickly)

---

CONTENT PILLARS (3-5 types):

EXAMPLE (Tech channel):
1. Product reviews (60%): Detailed, honest reviews
2. Tutorials (20%): How to use tech, troubleshooting
3. News/commentary (10%): Industry trends, opinions
4. Behind-the-scenes (10%): Studio setup, daily vlog

BENEFIT: Variety (keeps fresh), consistency (audience knows what to expect)

---

CONTENT CALENDAR:

WEEKLY POSTING SCHEDULE:
- YouTube: 1-2× per week (consistent day/time, e.g., Tuesdays 3pm)
- TikTok/Instagram Reels: Daily (algorithm favors frequency)
- Twitter: 3-5× per day (high-volume platform)
- Newsletter: Weekly (deeper dives, behind-the-scenes)

BATCH CREATION:
- Film 4-8 videos in one day (same setup, outfit)
- Edit throughout week
- Schedule uploads (YouTube Studio, Buffer, Hootsuite)
- Benefit: Efficiency, consistency even if busy/sick

CONTENT BANK:
- Evergreen videos (always relevant, not time-sensitive)
  * "How to change a tire"
  * "Python tutorial for beginners"
- Post when: Vacation, burnout, emergency
```

---

## Video Production

```markdown
PRE-PRODUCTION:

SCRIPTING:
- Full script (word-for-word, teleprompter): Educational, complex topics
- Outline (bullet points, natural delivery): Vlogs, casual topics
- Hook (first 5 seconds): Grab attention, state value
  * ❌ "Hey guys, welcome back to my channel..."
  * ✅ "This $20 gadget saved me 10 hours last week. Here's how."

EXAMPLE SCRIPT STRUCTURE:
1. HOOK (0:00-0:05): Problem or payoff
2. INTRO (0:05-0:30): Who you are, what video is about
3. BODY (0:30-8:00): Main content (chunked, 1-2 min per point)
4. CONCLUSION (8:00-8:30): Recap, call-to-action (CTA)
5. OUTRO (8:30-9:00): Like, subscribe, next video

---

FILMING:

CAMERA:
- Budget ($0-$500): Smartphone (iPhone 13+, Pixel 7+)
  * Tip: Use back camera (better quality), clean lens, good lighting
- Mid-range ($500-$2,000): Sony ZV-E10, Canon M50 Mark II
- Professional ($2,000+): Sony A7 IV, Canon R6

AUDIO (More important than video quality!):
- Built-in mic: Poor (use only as backup)
- Lavalier mic (clip-on): Rode Wireless Go II ($300)
- Shotgun mic (on-camera): Rode VideoMic Pro+ ($200)
- USB mic (voiceover): Blue Yeti ($100), Shure SM7B ($400)

LIGHTING:
- Natural light: Free (film near window, overcast day = soft light)
- Ring light: $30-$100 (even lighting, catchlight in eyes)
- Softbox: $100-$300 (professional look, 3-point lighting)

3-POINT LIGHTING:
1. KEY LIGHT (Main, 45° angle, bright)
2. FILL LIGHT (Opposite side, softer, fills shadows)
3. BACK LIGHT (Behind, separates subject from background)

FRAMING:
- Rule of thirds (subject not centered, more dynamic)
- Eye level (not too high/low, unless creative choice)
- Headroom (space above head, not too much/little)

---

POST-PRODUCTION (Editing):

SOFTWARE:
- Free: DaVinci Resolve, iMovie, CapCut
- Paid: Adobe Premiere Pro ($20/mo), Final Cut Pro ($300 one-time)
- Mobile: CapCut, InShot (easy, fast for Reels/TikTok)

WORKFLOW:
1. ROUGH CUT: Remove mistakes, pauses, ums/ahs
   - J-cuts (audio starts before video): Smooth transitions
   - L-cuts (audio continues after video): Professional feel
2. B-ROLL: Overlay footage (product shots, screen recordings, cutaways)
   - Keeps visually interesting (not just talking head)
3. GRAPHICS: Lower thirds (name, title), text overlays (key points)
4. MUSIC: Background (subtle, 10-20% volume, not distracting)
   - Epidemic Sound ($15/mo), Artlist ($20/mo) - copyright-free
5. COLOR GRADE: Adjust exposure, contrast, saturation (consistent look)
6. EXPORT: H.264, 1080p or 4K, 20-30 Mbps bitrate

PACING:
- Cut often (every 3-5 seconds, keep attention)
- Zoom in/out (dynamic, emphasize points)
- Speed up/slow down (time-lapse, slow-motion)

---

THUMBNAILS (Most important for click-through rate!):

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- High contrast (bright colors, stand out in feed)
- Large text (3-5 words max, readable on mobile)
- Faces (emotion, eyes to camera, curiosity)
- Rule of thirds (subject left/right, not centered)

TOOLS:
- Canva ($13/mo, templates, easy)
- Photoshop ($20/mo, professional)
- Figma (free, collaborative)

A/B TESTING:
- YouTube allows thumbnail changes (test 2-3 versions)
- Compare CTR (click-through rate) after 48 hours
- Keep winner

EXAMPLES (High CTR):
- MrBeast: Bright colors, shocked face, big text
- MKBHD: Clean, minimal, product focused
- Ali Abdaal: Friendly face, curiosity gap ("You're Doing It Wrong")

---

TITLES (SEO + curiosity):

FORMULA:
- Keyword + Benefit/Curiosity
  * "iPhone 15 Pro Review - 3 Months Later"
  * "How I Make $10K/Month as a Content Creator"
  * "Why Everyone's Quitting Their Job (It's Not What You Think)"

KEYWORD RESEARCH:
- YouTube Search (autocomplete suggestions)
- Google Trends (rising topics)
- TubeBuddy, VidIQ (keyword tools, competition analysis)

AVOID:
- Clickbait (title doesn't match content, loses trust)
- All caps (LOOKS SPAMMY)
- Too long (>60 characters gets cut off)
```

## Platform Optimization

```markdown
YOUTUBE ALGORITHM:

RANKING FACTORS:
1. CLICK-THROUGH RATE (CTR): Thumbnail + title (how many clicks per impression?)
   - Good: 8-10%+, Average: 4-6%, Poor: <3%
2. WATCH TIME: How long viewers watch (average view duration ≥50% = good)
3. ENGAGEMENT: Likes, comments, shares (signals quality)
4. SESSION TIME: Do viewers watch more YouTube after your video? (platform wants to keep users on site)

OPTIMIZATION:
- Hook (first 30 seconds): State value, don't waste time
- Pattern interrupts (every 30-60 seconds): Change camera angle, B-roll, text, keep attention
- End screens (last 20 seconds): Suggest next video (keep them watching)
- Playlists (autoplay next video): Increase session time

---

TIKTOK/INSTAGRAM REELS ALGORITHM:

RANKING FACTORS:
1. COMPLETION RATE: % who watch to end (more important than views)
2. REWATCHES: Loop video (make ending connect to beginning)
3. SHARES: Highest signal (worth 10× likes)
4. COMMENTS: Engagement (controversial = good for algorithm)

OPTIMIZATION:
- Hook (first 1 second): Fast-paced, no intro
- Short (21-34 seconds sweet spot): Higher completion rate
- Trending audio (use popular sounds, discoverability)
- Captions (most watch without sound): Essential
- Loop (ending → beginning): Increase rewatches

---

YOUTUBE SEO:

DESCRIPTION:
- First 2 lines (visible before "Show More"): Hook, keywords
- Links (website, social, affiliate)
- Timestamps (chapters, improves SEO, user experience)
- Keywords (related terms, but natural, not stuffing)

TAGS:
- 5-8 relevant tags (YouTube says not very important, but doesn't hurt)
- Mix: Specific ("iPhone 15 Pro review"), broad ("smartphone")

CAPTIONS:
- Auto-generated (YouTube creates, but review for errors)
- Upload SRT file (more accurate, helps SEO, accessibility)

HASHTAGS:
- 3-5 in description (e.g., #tech #iphone #review)
- Appears above title, clickable, discoverability

---

ANALYTICS (What to track):

YOUTUBE STUDIO:
- CTR (click-through rate): 8%+ = good
- Average view duration: 50%+ = good
- Traffic sources:
  * Suggested videos (algorithm recommending you)
  * Browse features (homepage, subscriptions)
  * YouTube search (SEO working)
  * External (social media, website)
- Audience retention graph:
  * Drops at 30 sec? Hook weak
  * Spikes? Rewatch that part, repeat in future videos
- Demographics (age, gender, location): Understand audience

TIKTOK/INSTAGRAM:
- Average watch time: 80%+ = good (shorter videos)
- Shares: Most valuable metric
- Profile visits: Are viewers curious about you?
- Follower growth rate: Trending up or flat?
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Consistency > perfection** - Post regularly, improve over time (don't wait for perfect)
2. **Audience first** - Solve problems, entertain, educate (not about you, about them)
3. **Quality audio** - Poor audio = viewers leave (invest in mic before camera)
4. **Thumbnail + title** - 50% of success (can have great video, but no clicks = no views)
5. **Long-term mindset** - Takes 6-12 months to see growth (don't quit at 3 months)
