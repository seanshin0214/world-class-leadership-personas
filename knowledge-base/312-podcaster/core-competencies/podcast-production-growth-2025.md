## Podcast Planning

```markdown
FORMAT SELECTION:

INTERVIEW:
- Host interviews guests (1-on-1 or panel)
- Examples: Joe Rogan Experience, How I Built This
- Pros: Guest brings audience, varied content, less prep
- Cons: Quality depends on guest, scheduling challenges

SOLO/MONOLOGUE:
- Host speaks alone (thoughts, stories, education)
- Examples: Dan Carlin's Hardcore History, The Daily (sometimes)
- Pros: Full creative control, no scheduling
- Cons: Must carry entire episode, can feel one-sided

CO-HOSTED:
- 2+ hosts discuss topic
- Examples: Reply All, My Favorite Murder
- Pros: Dynamic conversation, chemistry, banter
- Cons: Scheduling (coordinate multiple people), personalities must mesh

NARRATIVE/STORYTELLING:
- Scripted, produced stories (like audio documentary)
- Examples: Serial, Radiolab, This American Life
- Pros: Highly engaging, immersive, professional
- Cons: Time-intensive (research, scripting, production)

HYBRID:
- Mix formats (interviews + solo + narrative)
- Pros: Variety, flexibility
- Cons: May confuse audience (inconsistent format)

---

NICHE SELECTION:

SPECIFIC > BROAD:
- "Business podcast" (too broad, saturated)
- "Bootstrapped SaaS founders' growth strategies" (specific, underserved)

PASSION + KNOWLEDGE + AUDIENCE:
- Passion: Can talk about it for hours (sustain 50+ episodes)
- Knowledge: Expertise, credibility
- Audience: People want to listen (demand exists)

COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS:
- Search Apple Podcasts, Spotify for niche
- Top podcasts: What do they do well? Gaps?
- Opportunity: Underserved angle, different format, unique voice

---

EPISODE STRUCTURE:

INTRO (30-60 sec):
- Hook (interesting question, fact, story)
- Theme music
- Show name, host introduction
- Episode topic overview
- Example: "Today we're diving into how Sarah turned her side hustle into a $1M business in 18 months."

MAIN CONTENT (20-60 min):
- Interview, discussion, story
- Segments (if applicable): News, Q&A, recommendations

OUTRO (30-60 sec):
- Recap key takeaways
- Call-to-action (subscribe, leave review, visit website, social media)
- Thank guest (if interview)
- Teaser for next episode
- Theme music

---

EPISODE LENGTH:

COMMUTE (20-30 min):
- Quick, digestible (daily news, solo commentary)
- Examples: The Daily, Up First

STANDARD (45-60 min):
- Most common (interview, deep dive)
- Fits attention span, commute

LONG-FORM (1-3+ hours):
- Deep conversations, storytelling
- Examples: Joe Rogan (2-3 hours), Hardcore History (4+ hours)
- Audience: Dedicated fans (casual listeners may skip)

CONSISTENCY > LENGTH:
- Pick length, stick to it (audience expectations)
- Better: 30 min every week > 90 min erratic schedule
```

## Audio Recording

```markdown
EQUIPMENT:

MICROPHONE (Most important):

BUDGET ($50-$100):
- USB: Audio-Technica ATR2100x, Samson Q2U (XLR + USB, versatile)
- Pros: Plug and play, no interface needed
- Cons: Limited upgrade path

MID-RANGE ($100-$300):
- XLR: Shure SM7B (industry standard, $400 but worth it), Rode PodMic ($100), Shure SM58 ($100, durable)
- Requires: Audio interface (Focusrite Scarlett Solo, $100-$150)
- Pros: Better sound quality, professional
- Cons: More equipment, setup

HIGH-END ($300+):
- Shure SM7B, Electro-Voice RE20, Neumann U87 ($3K+, studio)
- Pros: Best quality, pristine sound
- Cons: Expensive, diminishing returns (SM7B sufficient for 99% of podcasters)

---

AUDIO INTERFACE (If XLR mic):
- Focusrite Scarlett Solo, 2i2 ($100-$200)
- Behringer U-Phoria UM2 ($50, budget)
- Converts XLR analog signal → digital (USB to computer)

HEADPHONES:
- Closed-back (Audio-Technica ATH-M50x, Sony MDR-7506, $100-$150)
- Monitor audio (hear what you're recording, catch issues)

POP FILTER ($10-$30):
- Reduce plosives (P, B, T sounds)
- Foam or mesh

MIC STAND/BOOM ARM:
- Desktop stand (cheap, takes desk space)
- Boom arm (Rode PSA1, Blue Compass, $70-$100, better positioning)

---

RECORDING SPACE:

ACOUSTIC TREATMENT:
- Problem: Echo, reverb (room sounds hollow)
- Solutions:
  * Acoustic panels ($30-$100 each, foam or fiberglass, walls behind/beside mic)
  * Bass traps (corners, absorb low frequencies)
  * Closet (clothes absorb sound, DIY booth)
  * Blanket fort (hang blankets around recording area)
- Avoid: Hard surfaces (bare walls, windows), large empty rooms

NOISE REDUCTION:
- Turn off: AC, fans, refrigerator (hum in background)
- Close windows (traffic, birds, neighbors)
- Record at quiet times (early morning, late night)
- Inform household (don't interrupt, knock, vacuum)

---

RECORDING SOFTWARE (DAW):

FREE:
- Audacity (Windows, Mac, Linux - basic, good for beginners)
- GarageBand (Mac only)
- Reaper (Free trial, $60 license - powerful, professional features)

PAID:
- Adobe Audition ($20/mo - industry standard, excellent for audio editing)
- Logic Pro ($200 one-time, Mac)
- Pro Tools ($30/mo, industry standard for music/audio)

SETTINGS:
- Sample rate: 48 kHz (broadcast standard) or 44.1 kHz (CD quality)
- Bit depth: 24-bit (more dynamic range, better for editing)
- Format: WAV (uncompressed, high quality for editing)

---

REMOTE RECORDING (Guests not in same room):

TOOLS:

ZOOM (Free):
- Video call, record audio
- Pros: Free, easy, most people have it
- Cons: Compressed audio (lower quality), internet dependent

RIVERSIDE.FM ($20-$80/mo):
- Records locally (each person's audio separate, high quality)
- Uploads after call (not live streaming, so internet hiccups don't affect quality)
- Pros: Best quality remote recording, video option
- Cons: Paid

SQUADCAST ($20-$80/mo):
- Similar to Riverside (local recording, high quality)

ZENCASTR ($20/mo):
- Local recording, separate tracks

RECORDING SETUP:
- Each person: Good mic, headphones, quiet space
- Separate tracks (edit individually, fix issues, level match)
- Internet: Stable connection (ethernet better than WiFi)
```

## Audio Editing

```markdown
EDITING WORKFLOW:

1. IMPORT AUDIO:
   - Drag files into DAW
   - Sync tracks (if multi-track, clap or count "3, 2, 1" at start, align waveforms)

2. REMOVE MISTAKES:
   - Cut: Coughs, long pauses, ums/ahs (excessive), off-topic tangents, false starts
   - Don't over-edit: Some pauses natural (breathing room), occasional "um" humanizes

3. TIGHTEN:
   - Reduce dead air (long silences between sentences)
   - Keep natural pace (not robotic, leave some pause)

4. ADD MUSIC/SFX:
   - Intro music (15-30 sec, fade in)
   - Outro music (15-30 sec, fade out)
   - Transitions (between segments, if applicable)
   - Music sources: Epidemic Sound ($15/mo, unlimited), Artlist ($15/mo), Free Music Archive (free, Creative Commons)

5. LEVEL/MIX:
   - Voice loudest (primary content)
   - Music softer (background, not competing, -15 to -20 dB below voice)
   - Duck music (lower volume when speaking, raise during pauses)

6. POST-PROCESSING:
   - Noise reduction (remove background hum, hiss)
   - EQ (equalization): Boost clarity (2-5 kHz), reduce muddiness (200-500 Hz)
   - Compression: Even out volume (loud parts quieter, quiet parts louder, 3:1 to 6:1 ratio)
   - De-esser: Reduce harsh "S" sounds (sibilance)
   - Limiter: Prevent clipping (peak at -1 dB)

7. NORMALIZE/LOUDNESS:
   - Target: -16 LUFS (Spotify, Apple Podcasts standard)
   - Use loudness meter plugin (Youlean Loudness Meter, free)
   - Don't just normalize peak (use LUFS for consistent perceived loudness)

8. EXPORT:
   - Format: MP3 (most compatible, small file size)
   - Bit rate: 128 kbps (mono, voice only), 192 kbps (stereo, music)
   - Mono vs Stereo: Mono (voice only, saves bandwidth), Stereo (music, immersive)

AUDIO ENHANCEMENT PLUGINS:

AUPHONIC (Free tier, $11/mo paid):
- Automated: Loudness normalization, noise reduction, leveling
- Upload raw audio → download processed (saves time)

DESCRIPT ($15/mo):
- Edit audio by editing text (transcribes, delete words in transcript → removes from audio)
- Overdub: AI voice cloning (re-record mistakes without re-recording)
- Pros: Fast editing, Cons: May sound robotic if overused

1. **Audio quality matters** - Invest in good mic, quiet space (listeners forgive content errors, not bad audio)
2. **Consistency > perfection** - Release schedule (weekly, biweekly, stick to it, build habit for listeners)
3. **Niche down** - Specific audience (easier to grow, monetize than broad)
4. **Promotion = 50% of work** - Recording is half, marketing/growth other half (don't neglect)
5. **Patience** - Growth slow (6-12 months to 1,000 downloads, keep creating, improving)
