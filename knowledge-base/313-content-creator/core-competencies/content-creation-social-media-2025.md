## Content Strategy

```markdown
NICHE SELECTION:

SPECIFIC > BROAD:
- "Fitness" (too broad, saturated) → "Calisthenics for beginners over 40" (specific, underserved)
- "Cooking" → "30-minute vegetarian meals for college students"
- "Tech" → "Budget gaming PC builds under $800"

PASSION + KNOWLEDGE + AUDIENCE:
- Passion: Can create 100+ videos (won't burn out)
- Knowledge: Expertise, authority (teach, solve problems)
- Audience: People searching for this (demand exists, monetizable)

COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS:
- Search niche on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram
- Top creators: What do they do well? Gaps in content?
- Opportunity: Different angle, better production, unique personality

---

CONTENT PILLARS (3-5 categories):

EXAMPLE (Fitness creator):
1. Workouts (tutorials, follow-along routines)
2. Nutrition (meal prep, recipes, tips)
3. Motivation (transformation stories, mindset)
4. Product reviews (gear, supplements)

BENEFITS:
- Variety (not repetitive)
- Organized (easy to plan content calendar)
- Audience knows what to expect (retention)

---

CONTENT CALENDAR:

PLAN 1-2 WEEKS AHEAD:
- Monday: Workout tutorial
- Wednesday: Nutrition tip
- Friday: Motivation/vlog
- Consistency > perfection (better to post regularly than wait for "perfect" video)

BATCH FILMING:
- Film 3-5 videos in one session (same setup, lighting, outfit)
- Edit throughout week (more efficient than film-edit-film-edit)

---

HOOK (First 3-5 seconds):

ATTENTION-GRABBING:
- Visual: Action, movement, bright colors (scroll-stopping)
- Text: Bold question or statement ("I lost 50 lbs doing this ONE thing")
- Audio: Music, sound effect, voice ("Wait, what?!")

PATTERN INTERRUPTS:
- Fast cuts, zoom, sfx (break monotony, keep attention)
- Example: Every 3-5 seconds, change angle, zoom, b-roll (TikTok/YouTube Shorts style)

CURIOSITY GAP:
- Promise value without giving it away ("The secret is..." *pause* "But first, let me explain")
- "You're doing this wrong" (why? watch to find out)

---

STORYTELLING (Beginning, Middle, End):

1. SETUP (Problem, relatable):
   - "I used to struggle with meal prep; I'd spend hours and still end up eating takeout..."

2. CONFLICT (Obstacle, tension):
   - "Then I tried meal prepping on Sundays, but I hated spending my whole day in the kitchen..."

3. RESOLUTION (Solution, payoff):
   - "Until I discovered this 3-step system that takes 90 minutes and lasts all week. Here's how..."

EMOTIONAL CONNECTION:
- Personal stories (vulnerable, authentic, relatable)
- "I failed 10 times before I figured this out" (struggle → success)
```

## Video Production

```markdown
EQUIPMENT:

BUDGET ($100-$300):
- Camera: iPhone, Android (good enough, 4K video)
- Mic: Rode VideoMicro ($60), Boya BY-M1 ($20, lavalier)
- Lighting: Ring light ($30-$50), or natural light (window, golden hour)
- Tripod: Amazon Basics ($20)

MID-RANGE ($300-$1,000):
- Camera: Sony ZV-1 ($700, vlogging focused), Canon M50 Mark II ($600, interchangeable lens)
- Mic: Rode VideoMic NTG ($200), Shure MV7 ($250, USB/XLR)
- Lighting: Softbox kit ($100, 2-3 lights, diffusion)
- Gimbal: DJI OM 4 ($150, smartphone stabilizer), DJI Ronin-SC ($300, camera)

HIGH-END ($1,000+):
- Camera: Sony A7 IV ($2,500, full-frame mirrorless), Canon R6 ($2,500)
- Lens: Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 ($2,200, versatile), Canon RF 50mm f/1.8 ($200, portraits)
- Mic: Sennheiser MKE 600 ($300), Rode Wireless Go II ($300)
- Lighting: Aputure 120D II ($700, LED panel, professional)

---

CAMERA SETTINGS:

FRAMERATE:
- 24 fps: Cinematic (film look, motion blur)
- 30 fps: Standard YouTube (natural, TV-like)
- 60 fps: Smooth (gaming, action, slow-motion capable)

RESOLUTION:
- 1080p: Standard (most viewers, smaller file size)
- 4K: Higher quality (future-proof, crop in post without losing quality)

EXPOSURE:
- Aperture (f-stop): Lower = blurry background (f/1.8-f/2.8, portrait), higher = sharp background (f/8-f/11, landscape)
- Shutter speed: 2× framerate (24 fps → 1/50, 30 fps → 1/60, for natural motion blur)
- ISO: Lowest possible (100-400, less noise), increase only if too dark

WHITE BALANCE:
- Auto (WB): Convenient, but can shift colors
- Manual: Set to lighting (3200K tungsten, 5600K daylight, consistent)

---

LIGHTING:

3-POINT LIGHTING (Classic setup):
1. KEY LIGHT: Main light (brightest, 45° to side and above, illuminate face)
2. FILL LIGHT: Opposite side (softer, 50% key brightness, reduce shadows)
3. BACK LIGHT: Behind subject (separate from background, rim light, depth)

NATURAL LIGHT:
- Window: Best (soft, flattering, free)
- Position: Face window (not backlit, unless intentional silhouette)
- Diffusion: Sheer curtain (soften harsh sunlight)
- Golden hour: Sunrise, sunset (warm, flattering, 1 hour before/after)

---

AUDIO:

IMPORTANCE:
- Viewers forgive bad video (not bad audio)
- Invest in mic early (higher priority than camera upgrade)

RECORDING TIPS:
- Close to mouth: 6-12 inches (lavalier clipped to shirt, shotgun on camera)
- Quiet environment: Turn off AC, fridge, close windows (traffic, birds)
- Room treatment: Soft surfaces (couch, carpet, curtains absorb echo), avoid empty rooms

EDITING:
- Normalize audio: -3 dB to -1 dB peak (consistent volume)
- Noise reduction: Remove background hum (Audacity, Adobe Audition, Premiere Pro)
- EQ: Boost clarity (2-5 kHz), reduce muddiness (200-500 Hz)
```

## Video Editing

```markdown
SOFTWARE:

FREE:
- CapCut (Mobile, desktop - easy, templates, TikTok/YouTube integration)
- DaVinci Resolve (Professional, steep learning curve, free version powerful)
- iMovie (Mac only, simple, intuitive)

PAID:
- Adobe Premiere Pro ($20/mo - industry standard, powerful, integrates with After Effects)
- Final Cut Pro ($300 one-time, Mac only - fast, magnetic timeline)

---

EDITING WORKFLOW:

1. ORGANIZE:
   - Import all footage, audio, music
   - Create bins/folders (A-roll, B-roll, SFX, music)

2. ROUGH CUT:
   - Place A-roll (main footage, talking head) on timeline
   - Cut out mistakes, pauses, ums (tighten, fast-paced)
   - Trim silence (leave 0.5-1 sec breathing room, not jarring)

3. ADD B-ROLL (Overlay footage):
   - Cover jump cuts (hide cuts, visually interesting)
   - Examples: Product shots, screen recordings, stock footage, action shots
   - B-roll over every 3-5 seconds (YouTube Shorts/TikTok), or every 10-15 seconds (long-form)

4. ADD MUSIC:
   - Background music (low volume, -20 to -15 dB, not competing with voice)
   - Duck music (lower when speaking, raise during pauses)
   - Sources: Epidemic Sound ($15/mo), Artlist ($15/mo), YouTube Audio Library (free, limited)

5. ADD SOUND EFFECTS (SFX):
   - Whooshes (transitions), boings (fun), impacts (emphasis)
   - Subtle (not every cut, use for emphasis)
   - Sources: Freesound.org, Zapsplat (free), Boom Library (paid, professional)

6. ADD TEXT/GRAPHICS:
   - Lower thirds (name, title, info)
   - Captions (accessibility, most watch without sound)
   - Key points (emphasize words, visual interest)

7. COLOR GRADE (Optional):
   - Correct: White balance, exposure (make it look natural)
   - Grade: Creative look (cinematic, warm, cool, teal/orange)
   - LUTs (Look-Up Tables): Presets (apply color grade, shortcuts)

8. EXPORT:
   - Format: H.264 (MP4, most compatible)
   - Resolution: 1080p (YouTube/Instagram), 4K (if filmed in 4K)
   - Framerate: Same as filmed (24, 30, or 60 fps)
   - Bitrate: 15-20 Mbps (1080p), 40-50 Mbps (4K, high quality, not over-compressed)

---

EDITING STYLE:

FAST-PACED (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Reels):
- Cut every 2-5 seconds (new angle, zoom, B-roll, text)
- Quick transitions (cuts, no dissolves)
- Trending audio, effects

CONVERSATIONAL (YouTube long-form):
- Slower cuts (every 10-20 seconds, allow breathing room)
- B-roll to illustrate points
- Music bed (subtle, background)

CINEMATIC (Vlogs, storytelling):
- Slower pacing (hold shots 5-10 seconds, appreciate visuals)
- Smooth transitions (dissolves, fades)
- Color grade (moody, warm, film look)
- Emotional music (swells, builds)
```

## Platform Strategy

```markdown
YOUTUBE:

STRENGTHS:
- Long-form (8-20 min videos, deep value)

  * Example: "How I Built a $10K/Month YouTube Channel in 6 Months (Full Strategy)"
- Thumbnail: High-contrast, readable text, close-up face (emotions, curiosity)
- Description: First 2-3 sentences (show in search, include keywords), timestamps, links
- Tags: 5-10 relevant (not overstuffed, YouTube prioritizes title/description)
- Cards & End screens: Link to other videos (keep viewers on channel)

SHORTS:
- Vertical (9:16), <60 seconds
- Hook first 1 second (scroll speed)
- Repurpose TikTok/Reels content
