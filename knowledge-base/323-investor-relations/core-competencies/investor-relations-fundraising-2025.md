## The Perfect Pitch Deck

### 15-Slide Structure

```markdown
SLIDE 1: COVER
- Company name & tagline
- One-liner: "We help [target customer] achieve [outcome] by [how]"
- Example: "We help marketing teams increase ROI by 3x with AI-powered analytics"

SLIDE 2: PROBLEM
- What problem are you solving?
- Who has this problem?
- How painful is it? (quantify)
- Current solutions (why they suck)

Example:
"Marketing teams spend 20 hours/week on manual reporting
instead of strategy. Current tools are complex, expensive ($50K/year),
and require data analysts to operate."

SLIDE 3: SOLUTION
- How do you solve it?
- Product demo (screenshots, not just mockups)
- Key features (3-5 main capabilities)
- Unique value proposition

Example:
"Acme Analytics: AI-powered marketing analytics in 3 clicks
- Connect data sources (5 min setup)
- AI generates insights automatically
- Beautiful dashboards (no analyst required)
Result: Save 15 hours/week, increase ROI visibility by 10x"

SLIDE 4: MARKET SIZE
- TAM (Total Addressable Market): $50B
- SAM (Serviceable Available Market): $10B
- SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market): $500M (in 5 years)

Show math:
TAM = 100K companies × $50K average spend = $5B
(back it up with data: Gartner, CB Insights, etc.)

### Common Due Diligence Questions

```markdown
BUSINESS MODEL:

A: "40% inbound (content marketing, SEO, $50K/month spend, 300 MQLs),
   30% outbound (5 SDRs, 10 AEs), 20% partnerships, 10% events."

Q: "How do you calculate LTV?"
A: "LTV = ARPU × Gross Margin / Churn Rate
   = $500/month × 80% / 3% monthly churn
   = $13,333"

COMPETITION:
Q: "What if Google/Microsoft builds this?"
A: "They could, but:
   1. We're 2-3 years ahead (proprietary ML models)
   2. We're focused on SMB/mid-market (not their focus)
   3. Our NPS is 72 (competitors <40)
   We'd welcome being acquired by them!"

TEAM:
Q: "What happens if your CTO leaves?"
A: "We have:
   1. Strong #2 engineer (10 years experience)
   2. Vesting schedule (4-year with 1-year cliff)
   3. Bus factor of 3+ on all critical systems"

RISKS:
Q: "What keeps you up at night?"
A: "Three things:
   1. Competition (we're adding features faster)
   2. Hiring (we need to 3x team in 12 months)
   3. Scaling infrastructure (we're planning ahead)"

Don't hide weaknesses - address them with mitigation plans!

## Term Sheet Negotiation

### Key Terms

```markdown
VALUATION:
- Pre-money: $100M
- Investment: $20M
- Post-money: $120M
- Price per share: $10.00
- Fully diluted shares: 12M

→ Investor owns: $20M / $120M = 16.7%

LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE:
Standard: 1x non-participating
- Investor gets $20M back first, then pro-rata
- Example exit: $80M → Investor gets $20M + 16.7% × $60M = $30M

Avoid: 2x participating
- Investor gets $40M first, then 16.7% × $40M = $46.7M
- Founder gets less!

ANTI-DILUTION:
Weighted-average (standard)
- Protects investor if you raise a down round
- Formula adjusts price per share

Avoid: Full ratchet
- If you raise at $5/share (down from $10), investor's price resets to $5
- Heavily punishes founders

BOARD COMPOSITION:
Ideal: 5 seats
- 2 Founders
- 2 Investors
- 1 Independent
→ No one has control

Avoid: Investor control (3 investor seats out of 5)

PRO-RATA RIGHTS:
- Investor can maintain ownership % in future rounds
- Standard for Series A+

VESTING:
Standard: 4-year vest, 1-year cliff
- Founder gets 25% after 1 year, then monthly
- Protects company if founder leaves early

DRAG-ALONG:
- If majority shareholders approve sale, minority must follow
- Standard (prevents holdouts from blocking exits)

NO-SHOP:
- 30-45 days (you can't talk to other investors)
- Reasonable: 30-45 days
- Red flag: 90+ days
```

### Negotiation Strategy

```markdown
BEFORE NEGOTIATION:
1. Get multiple term sheets (creates leverage)
2. Understand market terms (ask lawyers, other founders)
3. Prioritize what matters (valuation vs control vs investor quality)

DURING NEGOTIATION:
1. Don't negotiate via email (phone or in-person)
2. Focus on win-win (adversarial = bad relationship)
3. Get advice (lawyer, advisors, other founders)

WHAT TO NEGOTIATE:
✅ Valuation (if you have multiple offers)
✅ Liquidation preference (1x non-participating is standard)
✅ Board seats (maintain founder control if possible)
✅ Option pool (increase after, not before, investment)

❌ Don't be greedy (bad reputation spreads)
❌ Don't optimize for valuation alone (wrong investor = death)

RED FLAGS:
🚩 No pro-rata rights offered (investor doesn't believe in you)
🚩 Full ratchet anti-dilution (punitive)
🚩 Investor control (3+ board seats)
🚩 Participating preferred (double-dipping)
🚩 Long no-shop (60+ days)
```
