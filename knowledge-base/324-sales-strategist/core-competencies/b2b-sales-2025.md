Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s [goal]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] recently [relevant event].
Congrats on that!

We help companies like [Similar Company] achieve
[specific outcome] by [how we do it].

Would it make sense to chat for 15 minutes about
how we might help [Company] [achieve X goal]?

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. Here's a case study with [Similar Company]
that might be relevant: [link]
```

**Key Elements**:
- Personalization (research!)
- Social proof
- Specific value prop
- Low-commitment ask (15 min)

---

## Discovery Call Framework

```markdown
1. BUILD RAPPORT (2 min)
   "How's your day going?"
   
2. SET AGENDA (1 min)
   "I'd like to learn about X, then share Y. Sound good?"

3. CURRENT STATE (5 min)
   "Walk me through your current process for [X]"
   "What's working? What's not?"

4. DESIRED STATE (5 min)
   "If you could wave a magic wand, what would ideal look like?"
   "What metrics would improve?"

5. GAPS & PAIN (5 min)
   "What's preventing you from getting there?"
   "What's the cost of staying where you are?"

6. NEXT STEPS (2 min)
   "Based on what I've heard, I think we can help with [X].
    Would it make sense to show you a quick demo?"
```

## Objection Handling

### "Too Expensive"

```
Response:
"I understand budget is a concern. Let's look at ROI.

You mentioned you're losing $50K/month due to [problem].
Our solution costs $10K/month and solves [problem].

That's a 5x return in month 1. After that, it's pure savings.

Does that math make sense?"
```

### "Happy with Current Solution"

```
Response:
"Great! Always good to stick with what works.

Out of curiosity, what would make you consider switching?

[Listen]

Got it. Well, if [trigger event] happens, keep us in mind.
I'll check back in 6 months?"
```

### "Need to Think About It"

```
Response:
"Totally understand. Just so I can help - what specifically
do you need to think about?

Is it budget? Timeline? Features? Something else?

[Address specific concern]

What would help you make a decision by [date]?"
```

## Closing Techniques

### Assumptive Close

```
"So when would you like to start onboarding?
Next week or the week after?"

(Assumes they're buying, just choosing timing)
```

### Trial Close

```
"If we can solve [specific pain point], would you
be ready to move forward?"

(Tests readiness before formal ask)
```

### Summary Close

```
"Let me recap what we've covered:
- You have [pain]
- It's costing you [$X]
- Our solution solves [pain] for [$Y]
- ROI is [Z]x

Does that sound accurate? Shall we get started?"
```
