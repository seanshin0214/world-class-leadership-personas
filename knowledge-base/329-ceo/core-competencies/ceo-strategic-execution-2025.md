# CEO Leadership & Strategic Execution 2025

**Updated**: 2025-11-23 | **Focus**: Strategy, Execution, People, Capital

---

## The CEO Job (Reality vs Perception)

```
❌ MYTH: CEO makes all decisions, sets vision, heroic leader
✅ REALITY: CEO orchestrates, prioritizes, allocates resources, removes blockers

TIME ALLOCATION (Successful CEOs):
- 30%: People (hire, develop, retain A-players)
- 25%: Strategy (long-term direction, market positioning)
- 20%: Execution (remove obstacles, make key decisions)
- 15%: Culture (values, accountability, communication)
- 10%: External (investors, board, customers, partnerships)

DECISIONS PER DAY: 70-100 (senior execs make 35-50)
QUALITY > QUANTITY: Best CEOs make fewer, better decisions
```

## Strategic Planning Framework

### The 3 Horizons Model (McKinsey)

```
HORIZON 1: Defend & Extend Core Business (70% of resources)
- Optimize existing products/services
- Incremental innovation
- Efficiency improvements
- Current revenue engine

HORIZON 2: Build Emerging Businesses (20% of resources)
- New products in adjacentmarkets
- New customer segments
- New business models
- Future revenue (1-3 years)

HORIZON 3: Create Transformational Opportunities (10% of resources)
- Moonshots, R&D
- Disruptive innovation
- Long-term bets
- Options on future (3-10 years)

BALANCE IS CRITICAL:
- Too much H1: Optimize yourself to irrelevance
- Too much H3: Burn cash on dreams
- Right mix: Grow today while building tomorrow
```

### Annual Strategic Planning Process

```

## Decision-Making Framework

### The Regret Minimization Framework (Jeff Bezos)

```python
def should_i_do_this(decision):
    """
    Project yourself to age 80, look back on your life.
    Will you regret NOT doing this?
    """
    
    # Type 1 Decisions: One-way doors (hard to reverse)
    # - Hiring a C-level executive
    # - Acquiring a company
    # - Pivoting the business
    # → Slow, careful, reversible
    
    type1_examples = [
        "Should we pivot to B2B from B2C?",
        "Should we acquire CompetitorX for $50M?",
        "Should we raise $100M Series C?"
    ]
    
    # Type 2 Decisions: Two-way doors (reversible)
    # - Launching a new feature
    # - Changing pricing (can revert)
    # - Running a marketing campaign
    # → Fast, experiment, learn
    
    type2_examples = [
        "Should we test $99/month pricing?",
        "Should we try LinkedIn ads?",
        "Should we launch feature X?"
    ]
    
    if decision in type1_examples:
        approach = "Slow & deliberate"
        team_involvement = "High (get input from many)"
        reversibility = "Low (hard to undo)"
        decision_speed = "Days to weeks"
    else:
        approach = "Fast & experimental"
        team_involvement = "Low (empower team to decide)"
        reversibility = "High (easy to undo)"
        decision_speed = "Hours to days"
    
    return {
        'approach': approach,
        'involvement': team_involvement,
        'reversibility': reversibility,
        'speed': decision_speed
    }

# Example usage
decision = "Should we acquire CompetitorX for $50M?"
framework = should_i_do_this(decision)

# Output:
# {
#     'approach': 'Slow & deliberate',
#     'involvement': 'High (get input from many)',
#     'reversibility': 'Low (hard to undo)',
#     'decision_speed': 'Days to weeks'
# }
```

### DACI Decision Framework

```
DRIVER: Owns decision, drives process
APPROVER: Final say (usually CEO for major decisions)
CONTRIBUTORS: Provide input, expertise
INFORMED: Notified of decision

Example: Should we open London office?

DRIVER: VP International (gathers data, makes recommendation)
APPROVER: CEO (final yes/no)
CONTRIBUTORS:
- CFO (financial analysis)
- VP Sales (market opportunity)
- VP Operations (hiring, legal, logistics)
- VP Product (localization requirements)

INFORMED:
- All employees (via announcement)
- Board (at next meeting)

TIMELINE:
Week 1-2: Driver gathers data from Contributors
Week 3: Driver presents recommendation to Approver
Week 4: Approver makes decision
Week 4+: Informed parties notified
```

## People Management (The #1 CEO Job)

### Hiring A-Players

```
A-PLAYER DEFINITION:
- Top 10% in their role
- Self-motivated, low maintenance
- Raises the bar for everyone
- 10x more productive than B-player

COST OF MIS-HIRE (C-LEVEL):
- Direct: $500K+ (salary, severance, replacement cost)
- Indirect: Lost opportunities, team morale, customer churn
- Total: $2-5M over 2 years

HIRING PROCESS (C-LEVEL):

STEP 1: Define Success Profile
- What does success look like in 12 months?
- Must-have vs nice-to-have skills
- Culture fit (values alignment)

STEP 2: Sourcing (100 candidates → 10 interviews → 1 offer)
- Headhunters ($50-100K fee, but worth it)
- Network referrals (best source)
- Passive candidates (not actively looking)

STEP 3: Structured Interviews
Interview 1 (60 min): Career History
- Walk through resume chronologically
- Dig deep into each role (achievements, failures, why left)
- Pattern recognition (trajectory, growth mindset)

Interview 2 (90 min): Case Study
- Real problem from your company
- "How would you approach [challenge]?"
- Evaluate thinking process, not perfect answer

Interview 3 (60 min): Team Fit
- Meet potential direct reports
- Meet peers (other VPs)
- Assess collaboration style

Interview 4 (45 min): Values & Culture
- Describe a time you had to make a hard decision
- How do you give/receive feedback?
- What's your management philosophy?

STEP 4: Reference Checks (CRITICAL!)
- 5-7 references (not just the ones they give you)
- Back-channel references (LinkedIn connections)
- Questions:
  * "On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate this person?"
  * "Would you hire them again?"
  * "What's their superpower? What's their kryptonite?"

STEP 5: Offer (Close Fast!)
- Competitive compensation (don't cheap out on A-players)
- Sell the vision (why this is the opportunity of their career)
- Address concerns (spouse, relocation, risk)
```

### Performance Management

```markdown
QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE REVIEWS

1. SET GOALS (OKRs)
Objective: Grow revenue 2x
KR1: $25M → $50M ARR
KR2: Launch in 3 new markets
KR3: NRR >120%

2. TRACK PROGRESS (Weekly 1-on-1s)
- What's on track?
- What's blocked?
- How can I help?

3. EVALUATE (Quarterly)
Rating Scale:
- Exceeds (1.0+): 130% of goal, promotion-worthy
- Meets (0.7-1.0): On track, good performance
- Partially Meets (0.4-0.6): Below target, PIP
- Does Not Meet (<0.4): Termination

4. CALIBRATE (Forced Ranking)
- Top 20%: Exceeds (promote, raise, bonus)
- Middle 70%: Meets (standard raise/bonus)
- Bottom 10%: Partially/Does Not Meet (PIP or exit)

5. COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS
- Top performers: 15-25% raise + equity refresh
- Solid performers: 5-10% raise
- Underperformers: 0% raise + PIP

ANNUAL BONUS POOL:
- Company performance: 50% weight
- Individual performance: 50% weight

Example:
- Company hits 90% of goal → 90% of bonus pool
- Individual exceeds (1.2x) → Gets 1.2x their target bonus
- Net: 90% × 1.2 = 108% of target bonus
```

## Capital Allocation (CFO partnership)

### Fundraising Decision Tree

```
QUESTION 1: Do we need to raise?
└─ No → Focus on profitability, organic growth
└─ Yes (need capital) → Go to Q2

QUESTION 2: Can we be profitable in <2 years with current runway?
└─ Yes → Consider not raising (capital is expensive)
└─ No → Go to Q3

QUESTION 3: Is the market opportunity massive (>$1B)?
└─ No → Raise small round, focus on profitability
└─ Yes → Go to Q4

QUESTION 4: Can we achieve dominant market position with more capital?
└─ No → Raise strategically, don't overfund
└─ Yes → Raise aggressively, win the market

AMOUNT TO RAISE:
Conservative: 18-24 months runway
Aggressive: 36 months runway (expensive but safe)

EXAMPLE:
Current burn: $500K/month
Runway needed: 24 months
Amount to raise: $500K × 24 = $12M
Add buffer (20%): $14.4M
Target raise: $15M Series A
```

### Use of Funds (Pitch Deck)

```markdown
TOTAL RAISE: $15M

ALLOCATION:
1. Sales & Marketing (40% = $6M)
   - Hire 20 AEs ($4M/year salaries + commissions)
   - Marketing programs ($1.5M/year ads, events, content)
   - Sales tools & enablement ($0.5M)

2. Engineering (35% = $5.25M)

EXPECTED OUTCOMES (24 months):
