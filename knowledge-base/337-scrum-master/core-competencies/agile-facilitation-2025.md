## Facilitation Techniques

### 1. Liberating Structures

**1-2-4-All**:
```
1 min: Individual reflection
2 min: Pair discussion
4 min: Group of 4 shares
All: Groups share key insights

Use case: Retrospectives, brainstorming
```

**Troika Consulting**:
```
Person A: Presents challenge (2 min)
Persons B+C: Ask clarifying questions (3 min)
Persons B+C: Discuss solutions (3 min)
Person A: Reflects (1 min)

Rotate roles

Use case: Problem-solving
```

### 2. Decision-Making

**Fist of Five**:
```
Show fingers 0-5:
5: Strongly support, will champion
4: Support
3: Neutral
2: Have concerns, need discussion
1: Strong concerns, object
0: Block (veto)

Use case: Team decisions, consensus
```

**Dot Voting**:
```
1. List options on board
2. Each person gets 3-5 dots
3. Place dots on preferred options
4. Count votes, discuss top 3

Use case: Prioritization
```

## Team Coaching

### Tuckman's Stages

```
FORMING → STORMING → NORMING → PERFORMING

FORMING:
- Polite, uncertain
- SM: Set ground rules, clarify roles

STORMING:
- Conflicts emerge
- SM: Facilitate open communication

NORMING:
- Agreement on ways of working
- SM: Reinforce positive behaviors

PERFORMING:
- High productivity
- SM: Step back, empower team
```

### Coaching Stances

```
TEACHING: "Here's how Scrum works..."
Use when: New team, learning

MENTORING: "In my experience..."
Use when: Similar situation occurred

FACILITATING: "Let's discuss as team..."
Use when: Team capable, needs space

COACHING: "What options do you see?"
Use when: Mature team, self-organization
```

## Agile Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Common Mistakes

**Mini-Waterfall**:
```
Sprint = Design → Dev → Test → Deploy
(Should be: Vertical slicing, continuous integration)
```

**Scrum Theater**:
```
Going through motions without agile mindset
- Standup becomes status meeting
- Retro without actionable improvements
```

**Feature Factory**:
```
Shipping features without validating value
- No metrics
- No user feedback loops
```

---

## Continuous Improvement

### Kaizen Events

```markdown
MONTHLY:
1. Identify improvement area
2. Form cross-functional team
3. 1-day focused workshop
4. Implement changes immediately
5. Measure impact

EXAMPLES:
- Reduce build time from 30min → 10min
- Automate manual testing
- Improve documentation
```

### Definition of Done (DoD)

```markdown
CHECKLIST:
□ Code reviewed
□ Unit tests written (>80% coverage)
□ Integration tests pass
□ Documentation updated
□ Acceptance criteria met
□ Deployed to staging
□ Product Owner approved
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Servant leadership**: Remove obstacles, don't assign tasks
2. **Psychological safety**: Create environment for candor
3. **Empiricism**: Inspect & adapt based on data
4. **Continuous improvement**: Never settle
5. **Self-organizing teams**: Coach, don't control
