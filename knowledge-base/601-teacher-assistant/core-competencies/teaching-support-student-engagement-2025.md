## Small Group Instruction

```markdown
GUIDED READING (Elementary):

LEVELS:
- Emergent (K): Learning letters, sounds
- Early (K-1): CVC words (cat, dog), simple sentences
- Transitional (1-2): Longer sentences, sight words
- Fluent (3-5): Chapter books, complex vocabulary

GROUP SIZE: 4-6 students (same reading level)
DURATION: 15-20 minutes
FREQUENCY: 3-5× per week (rotate groups)

STRUCTURE:

BEFORE READING (5 min):
- Preview book (cover, pictures)
- Activate prior knowledge ("What do you know about...?")
- Introduce vocabulary (2-3 key words)
- Set purpose ("Read to find out...")

DURING READING (10 min):
- Students read silently or whisper read
- Teacher listens to each student (30 sec-1 min each)
- Prompt when stuck:
  * "Look at the picture"
  * "What would make sense?"
  * "Get your mouth ready for that sound"
- Note errors (running record)

AFTER READING (5 min):
- Comprehension questions:
  * Who, what, where, when, why, how
  * "Why do you think...?"
  * "What would you do if...?"
- Discuss story
- Word work (focus on 1-2 skills: digraphs, sight words, etc.)

---

MATH SMALL GROUP:

GROUP SIZE: 3-5 students (same skill gap)
DURATION: 15-20 minutes
FOCUS: Reteach or extend lesson

RETEACH (Struggling students):
1. Review concept (visual, manipulatives)
2. Model problem (think aloud, step-by-step)
3. Guided practice (students work with support)
4. Independent practice (check understanding)

Example: Addition with regrouping
- Use base-10 blocks (visual)
- "We have 7 ones and 5 ones. That's 12 ones. Do we have enough to make a ten?"
- Students manipulate blocks
- Practice 3-5 problems together
- Exit ticket (1-2 problems to check mastery)

EXTENSION (Advanced students):
- Challenge problems (word problems, multi-step)
- Real-world applications
- Math games (strategy, logic)
- Early algebra (patterns, variables)

---

INTERVENTION (Pull-out or push-in):

PULL-OUT:
- Remove students from classroom (separate space)
- Focus on deficit skill (30-45 min daily)
- Programs: Orton-Gillingham (reading), TouchMath (math)

PUSH-IN:
- Stay in classroom (co-teach with teacher)
- Support during instruction
- Stigma-free (students not removed)
```

## Behavioral Management

```markdown
POSITIVE BEHAVIOR SUPPORT:

PRAISE SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR:
- ❌ "Good job!"
- ✅ "I love how you raised your hand before speaking!"
- ✅ "Thank you for helping pick up those crayons!"
- ✅ "You worked so hard on that math problem!"

RATIO: 4:1 (4 positive comments for every 1 correction)

---

PROACTIVE STRATEGIES:

CLEAR EXPECTATIONS:
- Model desired behavior (show, don't just tell)
- Practice routines (line up, transition, turn in work)
- Consistent (same expectations every day)

PROXIMITY:
- Stand near students who need support
- Presence alone often enough (redirect without words)

CHOICE:
- "Would you like to sit at your desk or at the carpet?"
- "Do you want to do math first or reading?"
- Sense of control (reduce power struggles)

NON-VERBAL CUES:
- Eye contact
- Thumbs up / thumbs down
- Point to expected behavior chart
- Avoids calling out (less embarrassing)

---

CORRECTIVE STRATEGIES:

REDIRECT (First step):
- "Eyes on me, please"
- "Hands to yourself"
- Tap desk (remind to focus)
- Brief, neutral tone (not angry)

LOGICAL CONSEQUENCES:
- "You threw the pencil, so you need to pick it up"
- "You didn't finish your work, so you'll need to during recess"
- Related to behavior (not punitive)

TIME-OUT / BREAK:
- Remove from situation (calm down space)
- 1 minute per year of age (5 years old = 5 min)
- Not punishment (opportunity to self-regulate)
- Return when ready

TEACHER NOTIFICATION:
- If behavior escalates, inform teacher immediately
- Don't handle major issues alone (safety, severe defiance)

---

CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS:

TANTRUMS (PreK-K):
- Stay calm (your calm = their calm)
- Validate feelings ("I see you're frustrated")
- Ignore tantrum (don't reward with attention)
- Wait until calm, then redirect
- Teach coping strategies (deep breaths, count to 10)

DEFIANCE:
- Don't argue (power struggle)
- Offer choice ("You can do X or Y, you decide")
- Natural consequences ("If you don't finish work, you'll miss recess")
- Follow through (empty threats lose credibility)

DISRUPTION (Talking out, off-task):
- Nonverbal reminder (proximity, eye contact)
- Verbal reminder ("Back to work, please")
- Move seat (separate from peers if distracted)
- Conference (talk privately, "What's going on?")

AGGRESSION (Hitting, kicking):
- Safety first (separate students)
- Report to teacher/administrator immediately
- Document incident (who, what, when, where)
- Parent notification (teacher or admin handles)

---

FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR ASSESSMENT (FBA):

WHY is behavior happening?

ATTENTION:
- Student acts out to get teacher/peer attention
- Solution: Give attention for positive behavior (ignore minor misbehavior)

ESCAPE/AVOIDANCE:
- Student acts out to avoid task (too hard, boring)
- Solution: Modify task, provide support, teach coping skills

SENSORY:
- Student needs movement, stimulation
- Solution: Fidgets, movement breaks, sensory tools

TANGIBLE:
- Student wants item, activity
- Solution: Earn through positive behavior (token system)
```

2. **Be consistent** - Rules, routines, consequences (students need predictability)
3. **Build relationships** - Students work harder for people they like/respect
4. **Confidentiality** - Never discuss students outside school (legal & ethical)
5. **Ask questions** - Better to ask than make a mistake (no stupid questions)
