## Classroom Management Strategies

### Building Classroom Culture (First Week)

```markdown
DAY 1: ESTABLISH EXPECTATIONS

OPENING (20 min):
- Welcome & introductions
- Ice breaker activity (e.g., "Two Truths and a Lie")
- Share your "why" (why you became a teacher)
- Set the tone: "This classroom is a safe space to learn, make mistakes, and grow"

ESTABLISH NORMS TOGETHER (30 min):
- Brainstorm: "What does a great learning environment look like/sound like/feel like?"
- Students suggest rules (they buy in more if they create them)
- Consolidate to 4-6 core expectations:
  1. Be respectful (to others, to property, to learning time)
  2. Be responsible (complete work, be prepared, own mistakes)
  3. Be engaged (participate, ask questions, try your best)
  4. Be safe (physically and emotionally)

PROCEDURES & ROUTINES (20 min):
Teach explicitly (students don't assume!):
- How to enter classroom (quietly, get materials, start bell ringer)
- How to ask for help (raise hand, use help signal, visit help desk)
- How to turn in work (tray, digital submission)
- How to sharpen pencil (during work time, not instruction)
- How to use restroom (hand signal, take pass, one at a time)
- How to line up / transition
- End-of-class routine (pack up last 3 minutes, exit ticket, stack chairs)

PRACTICE:
- Model expectations (show correct & incorrect)
- Have students practice (e.g., practice lining up 3 times until perfect)
- "What I saw well...", "Next time..."

DAY 2-5: REINFORCE
- Review expectations daily first week
- Praise specific behaviors ("I love how Row 3 is ready with materials!")
- Reteach if necessary
- Be consistent (same expectations every day)

---

SEATING ARRANGEMENTS:

ROWS (Traditional):
- Best for: Testing, direct instruction
- Pros: Clear sightlines, minimize talking
- Cons: Less collaborative

GROUPS (4-6 students):
- Best for: Project-based learning, collaboration
- Pros: Easy partner work, student interaction
- Cons: More off-task behavior, management needed

U-SHAPE:
- Best for: Discussions, Socratic seminars
- Pros: Everyone sees each other, teacher can circulate inside
- Cons: Takes up space

FLEXIBLE SEATING:
- Standing desks, bean bags, floor cushions, wobble stools
- Best for: Student choice, kinesthetic learners
- Requires clear expectations & rotation system

STRATEGIC GROUPING:
- Separate known behavior issues
- Mix ability levels (high-med-low in each group)
- Consider language needs (ELL paired with strong English speaker)
- Change seats every 3-4 weeks (fresh start, new relationships)

---

ATTENTION SIGNALS:

Verbal:
- "Class, class!" → Students respond: "Yes, yes!"
- "If you can hear me, clap once" → (clap) → "Clap twice" → etc.

Non-verbal:
- Raise hand (students see, raise theirs, stop talking)
- Lights off (visual signal for quiet)
- Timer on board (countdown to transition)
- Chime, bell, rain stick

CONSISTENCY IS KEY:
- Use same signal every time
- Wait for 100% compliance before proceeding
- Praise quick responders
```

## Lesson Planning

### Backward Design (UbD Framework)

```markdown
STAGE 1: IDENTIFY DESIRED RESULTS

STANDARDS:
- What standards/learning objectives?
- Example (Math 8): "Students will solve multi-step equations with variables on both sides"

ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS:
- Open-ended, thought-provoking
- Example: "How do we solve problems when the answer isn't obvious?"

ENDURING UNDERSTANDINGS:
- Big ideas students will remember
- Example: "Equations are balanced, like a scale. What we do to one side, we must do to the other."

STAGE 2: DETERMINE ACCEPTABLE EVIDENCE

SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT:
- How will students demonstrate mastery?
- Example: Quiz with 10 multi-step equations (80% = proficient)

FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT:
- How will I check understanding along the way?
- Example: Exit ticket, white board checks, peer teaching

STAGE 3: PLAN LEARNING EXPERIENCES

LESSON SEQUENCE (60 min):
1. ENGAGE (5 min): Hook to activate prior knowledge
   - Real-world problem: "If I have $50, spend $20, earn $10, spend half, how much left?"
   
2. DIRECT INSTRUCTION (15 min): "I Do"
   - Model solving 3x + 5 = 2x + 12
   - Think aloud: "First, I need all variables on one side..."
   - Show multiple examples
   
3. GUIDED PRACTICE (20 min): "We Do"
   - Work 3-4 problems together
   - Cold call, turn-and-talk, white boards
   - Check for understanding frequently
   
4. INDEPENDENT PRACTICE (15 min): "You Do"
   - Students work individually
   - Teacher circulates, provides feedback
   - Pull small group for reteaching if needed
   
5. CLOSURE (5 min):
   - Exit ticket: 1-2 problems
   - "What was challenging today?"
   - Preview tomorrow

DIFFERENTIATION:
- Support (Struggling): Provide formula sheet, fewer problems, partner support
- Core (On-level): Standard practice
- Extension (Advanced): Word problems, create your own equations, teach a peer
```

## Student Engagement Strategies

### Active Learning Techniques

```markdown
THINK-PAIR-SHARE:
1. Think: "Take 30 seconds to think..."
2. Pair: "Turn to your partner and share..."
3. Share: "Who wants to share with the class?"

Benefits: Every student thinks, low-stakes, builds confidence

---

COLD CALLING (Equitable):
- Use popsicle sticks with names
- "No opt-out" policy (if student doesn't know, come back to them)
- "I'll give you time to think" (wait time = 3-5 seconds)

Avoids: Same 5 hands always up, other students tune out

---

WHITE BOARDS (Formative Assessment):
- Every student has small dry-erase board
- Pose question: "Solve 3x + 7 = 16"
- Students solve, hold up boards
- Instant feedback (teacher scans room, sees who's struggling)

Benefits: 100% participation, immediate data

---

TURN-AND-TALK:
- "Turn to your partner and explain..."
- 60-90 seconds
- Increases engagement, processing time

---

GALLERY WALK:
- Post chart paper around room with questions/problems
- Students rotate in groups, write responses
- Review together

Benefits: Movement, collaboration, visible thinking

---

SOCRATIC SEMINAR:
- Students sit in circle
- Open-ended question: "Is technology helping or hurting learning?"
- Students discuss (teacher as facilitator, not lecturer)
- Ground rules: Respect, listen, build on ideas, use evidence

Benefits: Critical thinking, speaking & listening skills

---

RETRIEVAL PRACTICE:
- Start class with "Do Now" reviewing yesterday's content
- Low-stakes quiz (not graded, just practice)
- Brain dump: "Write everything you remember about photosynthesis"

Benefits: Strengthens memory, identifies gaps
```

---

## Differentiation

### Tiered Assignments

```markdown
SAME OBJECTIVE, DIFFERENT COMPLEXITY:

Reading Comprehension Example:

TIER 1 (Approaching):
- Shorter text (1 page)
- Explicit questions ("Who is the main character?")
- Vocabulary support provided

TIER 2 (On-level):
- Grade-level text (2-3 pages)
- Mix of explicit & inferential questions
- Independent work

TIER 3 (Advanced):
- Challenging text (3-4 pages, complex vocabulary)
- Inferential & analytical questions ("What is the author's purpose?")
- Extension: "Write an alternate ending"

---

GROUPING STRATEGIES:

FLEXIBLE GROUPING (change based on need):
- Skill-based: Group by current mastery (pull struggling for reteach)
- Interest-based: Project choice (historical figure, scientific discovery)
- Heterogeneous: Mixed ability for peer tutoring
- Random: Popsicle sticks for variety

NOT TRACKING:
- Don't permanently label students ("low group")
- Groups should change every unit/project

---

SCAFFOLDS FOR ELL STUDENTS:

LANGUAGE SUPPORTS:
- Sentence frames: "I think ____ because ____"
- Word banks
- Bilingual glossary
- Visual aids (pictures, diagrams, videos)
- Simplified text (adjust reading level, not content)
- Extra processing time

GROUPING:
- Pair with strong English speaker
- Small group instruction
- Native language support when possible

ASSESSMENT:
- Allow verbal responses (if writing is barrier)
- Extended time
- Translated directions
```

---

## Assessment Strategies

### Formative Assessment (Checking for Understanding)

```markdown
EXIT TICKET (Last 3-5 minutes):
- 1-3 quick questions on today's objective
- Students turn in before leaving
- Teacher reviews that evening (data for tomorrow's lesson)

Examples:
- "Solve: 4x - 3 = 13"
- "Summarize in 2 sentences: Why did the Civil War start?"
- "What's one thing you learned today? One question you still have?"

FIST TO FIVE:
- "Show me on your hand: How well do you understand?"
  * Fist = Lost
  * 1 = Need lots of help
  * 3 = Getting it, need practice
  * 5 = Could teach someone else
- Quick visual check

FOUR CORNERS:
- Post A, B, C, D in corners
- Multiple choice question
- Students go to corner with their answer
- Discuss reasoning in corners
- Class debate

KAHOOT / QUIZIZZ:
- Digital quiz game (students use devices)
- Real-time feedback
- Engaging, competitive

OBSERVATION & ANECDOTAL NOTES:
- Circulate during independent work
- Clipboard with class roster
- Jot quick notes: "Sarah struggles with fractions", "Miguel strong today"
```

### Summative Assessment

```markdown
TESTS & QUIZZES:
- Align to standards & learning objectives
- Mix question types (multiple choice, short answer, extended response)
- Rubric for essays/projects

PROJECTS:
- Authentic application of learning
- Clear rubric (shared with students at start)
- Checkpoints along the way (avoid all-nighters)

Example Rubric (Research Paper):

| Criteria | 4 - Excellent | 3 - Proficient | 2 - Developing | 1 - Needs Improvement |
|----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Thesis | Clear, arguable, specific | Clear thesis | Vague thesis | Missing thesis |
| Evidence | 5+ sources, well-integrated | 3-4 sources | 1-2 sources | No sources |
| Organization | Logical flow, transitions | Mostly organized | Some organization | Disorganized |
| Grammar | 0-2 errors | 3-5 errors | 6-10 errors | 11+ errors |

PORTFOLIOS:
- Collection of student work over time
- Shows growth
- Student reflection on progress

PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS:
- Demonstration of skill (science lab, presentation, speech)
- Real-world application
```

## Behavior Management

### Positive Behavior Interventions

```markdown
PRAISE SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS (5:1 ratio - 5 positives for every 1 redirect):
❌ "Good job!"
✅ "I love how you showed your work on every problem!"

PROXIMITY:
- Walk near off-task student (often enough to redirect)
- Teach from all areas of room (not just front)

NON-VERBAL CUES:
- Eye contact
- Finger to lips (shh)
- Tap desk
- Point to directions on board

PRIVATE CORRECTION:
- Whisper to student (don't embarrass publicly)
- "I need you to put phone away"
- Calm, firm tone

CHOICE:
- "You can do this work now, or during recess. Your choice."
- "You can sit here and focus, or move to the back table to refocus."

CONSEQUENCES (LOGICAL & CONSISTENT):
1. Warning (non-verbal, then verbal)
2. Loss of privilege (move seat, sit out of game)
3. Recess/lunch detention (complete work, reflection sheet)
4. Parent contact (phone call home)
5. Office referral (serious/repeated violations)

AVOID POWER STRUGGLES:
❌ Arguing with student
❌ Yelling
❌ Sarcasm
✅ Stay calm, state expectation, follow through
```

## Building Relationships

```markdown
GREET STUDENTS AT DOOR:
- Say name, fist bump/high five
- "How was your game last night?"
- Sets positive tone

LUNCH BUNCH:
- Invite small group to eat lunch with you
- Casual conversation (not academic)
- Builds rapport

INTEREST INVENTORY:
- Survey: Hobbies, favorite subjects, goals
- Shows you care about them as individuals

ATTEND EVENTS:
- Go to student's soccer game, play, concert
- "I saw you scored a goal! Great job!"
- Huge impact on relationship

RESTORATIVE PRACTICES (After conflict):
- "What happened?"
- "Who was affected?"
- "What can you do to make it right?"
- Focus on repairing harm, not punishment

PHONE CALLS HOME (Positive):
- "I wanted to let you know Maria had a great day today..."
- Parents rarely get positive calls (game-changer)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Relationships first** - Students learn from teachers they trust
2. **Be consistent** - Expectations, routines, consequences
3. **Engage actively** - Passive listening ≠ learning
4. **Differentiate** - One size doesn't fit all
5. **Reflect & improve** - What worked? What didn't? Adjust.
