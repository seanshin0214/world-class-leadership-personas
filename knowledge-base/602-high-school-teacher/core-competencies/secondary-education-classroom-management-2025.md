## Lesson Planning

```markdown
BACKWARD DESIGN (Start with end goal):

1. IDENTIFY DESIRED RESULTS (Standards & objectives):
   - What should students know/do by end of lesson?
   - Align with state standards (Common Core, NGSS, etc.)
   
   Example:
   - Standard: CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.9-10.1 (Write arguments)
   - Objective: "Students will write a 5-paragraph argumentative essay with a clear thesis, supporting evidence, and counterargument."

2. DETERMINE ACCEPTABLE EVIDENCE (Assessment):
   - How will you know students learned?
   - Formative (during lesson): Exit ticket, cold call, thumbs up/down
   - Summative (end of unit): Essay, test, project
   
3. PLAN LEARNING EXPERIENCES (Activities):
   - What activities will help students achieve objective?
   - Sequence: Warm-up → Instruction → Practice → Assessment

---

LESSON PLAN TEMPLATE:

OBJECTIVE (SWBAT - Students Will Be Able To):
- "SWBAT identify main idea and supporting details in a nonfiction text"
- Measurable, specific, one lesson

MATERIALS:
- Article (printed, 1 per student)
- Highlighters
- Graphic organizer
- Projector

WARM-UP (5-10 min):
- Hook: Engage students, activate prior knowledge
- Example: "What's the difference between topic and main idea?"
- Do Now: Students answer in notebook while teacher takes attendance

INSTRUCTION (15-20 min):
- I Do (Model): Teacher demonstrates (think aloud)
  * "I'm going to read this paragraph and identify the main idea. First, I ask myself: What is this mostly about?"
- We Do (Guided practice): Do together (call on students)
  * "Now let's try the next paragraph together. What's the main idea?"
- You Do (Independent practice): Students work alone
  * "Finish the article, highlight main idea and 3 supporting details"

CHECK FOR UNDERSTANDING (Throughout):
- Cold call (random student, not just volunteers)
- Thumbs up/down/sideways (quick gauge)
- Turn and talk (pair share, then report out)
- Exit ticket (end of class, formative assessment)

CLOSURE (5 min):
- Summarize key points
- Preview tomorrow
- Collect exit ticket

DIFFERENTIATION:
- Struggling: Shortened article, sentence starters, pair with strong student
- Advanced: Extension question, deeper analysis, peer tutor
- ELLs: Visual aids, glossary, translation tool

HOMEWORK:
- Practice skill (10-20 min max)
- Example: "Read article, write 3 sentences summarizing main idea"

---

PACING:

HIGH SCHOOL (50-min period):
- 5 min: Warm-up (settle in, attendance)
- 10 min: Review homework / previous lesson
- 20 min: New content (instruction, guided practice)
- 10 min: Independent practice
- 5 min: Closure, exit ticket

BLOCK SCHEDULE (90-min period):
- Chunk into 20-30 min segments (variety)
- Movement breaks (stand, stretch, pair share)
- Multiple activities (lecture → discussion → lab → reflection)

AVOID:
- Teacher talking entire period (students zone out after 10-15 min)
- No clear objective (students don't know what they're learning)
- One activity whole period (boring, doesn't fit all learning styles)
```

## Student Engagement

```markdown
ACTIVE LEARNING STRATEGIES:

THINK-PAIR-SHARE:
1. Think (1 min): Students reflect individually
2. Pair (2 min): Discuss with partner
3. Share (3 min): Pairs report out to class
- Benefit: All students participate (not just hand-raisers)

COLD CALL:
- Call on random student (not just volunteers)
- "Equity sticks" (popsicle sticks with names, draw one)
- Tip: Give think time first (5-10 sec), then call name
  * "Think about... [pause 5 sec]... Okay, Maria, what do you think?"
- Creates accountability (all students must be ready to answer)

TURN AND TALK:
- Quick pair discussion (30 sec - 1 min)
- "Turn to your neighbor and explain..."
- Benefit: Processing, low-stakes, movement

GALLERY WALK:
- Post chart paper around room
- Groups rotate, add to each poster
- Review all responses at end
- Benefit: Movement, collaboration, see peers' ideas

JIGSAW:
- Split reading/content into chunks
- Each student becomes "expert" on one chunk
- Teach to peers (home group)
- Benefit: Peer teaching, accountability

SOCRATIC SEMINAR:
- Student-led discussion (teacher facilitates, not lectures)
- Outer circle observes, takes notes
- Inner circle discusses text-based questions
- Benefit: Critical thinking, listening, building on others' ideas

TECHNOLOGY:
- Kahoot (quiz game, competitive)
- Quizizz (self-paced quiz)
- Padlet (virtual sticky notes, brainstorm)
- Nearpod (interactive slides, formative assessment)
- Desmos (math activities, visual)

---

QUESTIONING TECHNIQUES:

BLOOM'S TAXONOMY (Low → High):

REMEMBER (Recall facts):
- "What is the capital of France?"
- "Define photosynthesis."

UNDERSTAND (Explain):
- "Summarize the main idea."
- "What caused the Civil War?"

APPLY (Use knowledge):
- "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15"
- "Use this formula to calculate velocity."

ANALYZE (Compare, contrast):
- "What's the difference between mitosis and meiosis?"
- "Compare the characters in these two stories."

EVALUATE (Judge, critique):
- "Which solution is best? Why?"
- "Do you agree with the author? Defend your answer."

CREATE (Design, construct):
- "Design an experiment to test..."
- "Write an alternate ending."

AIM: 80% higher-order questions (Analyze, Evaluate, Create)

---

WAIT TIME:
- After asking question: Wait 3-5 seconds before calling on student
- Benefit: More students raise hands, higher-quality responses
- Tip: Count silently ("one-one-thousand, two-one-thousand...") - feels long, but necessary

FOLLOW-UP:
- "Can you say more about that?"
- "Why do you think that?"
- "Does anyone want to add on?"
- Push for evidence: "What in the text makes you say that?"

---

HOOKS (Start of lesson):

PROVOCATIVE QUESTION:
- "Would you rather be rich or famous?"
- Debate, then connect to lesson (e.g., Gatsby: wealth vs. happiness)

VIDEO CLIP (1-3 min):
- Relevant, engaging (not entire 20-min video)
- Example: Biology - "How does a virus work?" (animation)

REAL-WORLD CONNECTION:
- "Have you ever wondered why..."
- "This happened in the news yesterday..."

BRAIN TEASER / PUZZLE:
- Math problem, logic puzzle
- Gets minds working, curiosity

DEMO / EXPERIMENT:
- Science: Chemical reaction (visual, memorable)
- "What do you think will happen?"
```

---

## Differentiation

```markdown
READINESS (Skill level):

TIERED ASSIGNMENTS:
- Same objective, different complexity
- Example (Math - Solving equations):
  * Tier 1: One-step (x + 5 = 10)
  * Tier 2: Two-step (2x + 5 = 15)
  * Tier 3: Multi-step with variables on both sides (3x + 5 = 2x + 10)

SCAFFOLDING (Struggling students):
- Graphic organizers (fill-in-the-blank notes)
- Sentence starters ("I believe... because...")
- Word banks
- Chunk text (read paragraph by paragraph, not whole page)
- Simplified language
- Extra time

EXTENSION (Advanced students):
- Deeper questions ("What if...?")
- Independent research
- Create, don't just consume (design project, teach concept to class)
- Challenge problems (optional, for early finishers)

---

INTEREST:

CHOICE BOARDS:
- Grid of activities (3×3 or 2×2)
- Students choose how to demonstrate learning
- Example (Novel study):
  * Create a movie poster
  * Write a diary entry from character's perspective
  * Design a Pinterest board for character
  * Act out a scene
  * All achieve same objective (analyze character)

LEARNING MENUS:
- Appetizer (must do)
- Entrée (choice of 2/3)
- Dessert (optional, for extra credit)

---

LEARNING PROFILE (How students learn):

VISUAL:
- Diagrams, charts, graphic organizers
- Color-coding
- Videos, images

AUDITORY:
- Lectures, discussions
- Podcasts, audiobooks
- Mnemonic devices, songs

KINESTHETIC:
- Hands-on activities
- Movement (act out, manipulatives)
- Labs, experiments

FLEXIBLE GROUPING:
- Homogeneous (same level, target instruction)
- Heterogeneous (mixed levels, peer teaching)
- Random (build community, avoid cliques)
- Change regularly (not permanent "low" group)
```

---

## Classroom Management

```markdown
FIRST DAY / WEEK:

ESTABLISH EXPECTATIONS:
- Post rules (3-5 max, positive language)
  * ✅ "Respect others" (not "No talking")
  * ✅ "Be prepared" (not "Don't forget materials")
  * ✅ "Try your best" (not "No sleeping")
- Model, practice, reinforce
- Consequences: Consistent, progressive (warning → parent contact → detention → admin)

BUILD COMMUNITY:
- Learn names (use name tents, flashcards)
- Icebreakers (find someone who, two truths and a lie)
- Share something about yourself (humanize, relatability)

PROCEDURES:
- Entering class (Do Now on board, start immediately)
- Turning in work (inbox, don't hand to teacher during instruction)
- Sharpening pencils (before class or after, not during)
- Bathroom (sign-out sheet, one at a time)
- Getting materials (designate materials manager, not everyone at once)
- Dismissal (bell doesn't dismiss, teacher does)
- Practice, practice, practice (first week)

---

PROACTIVE STRATEGIES:

PROXIMITY:
- Stand near students who need support
- Circulate (don't stay at front)
- Monitor, redirect without interrupting lesson

POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT:
- Praise publicly, correct privately
- Specific ("I love how you showed your work")
- 4:1 ratio (4 positives for every 1 correction)

NONVERBAL CUES:
- Eye contact
- Thumbs up / down
- Point to expectation poster
- Proximity
- Pause (silence gets attention)

ENGAGING LESSONS:
- Boring lesson = behavior problems
- Variety, movement, relevance

---

CORRECTIVE STRATEGIES (Progressive):

1. NONVERBAL (First step):
   - Proximity, eye contact, pause
   - Most effective, least disruptive

2. VERBAL REMINDER (Private, if possible):
   - "Eyes up here, please"
   - Calm, neutral tone (not angry)

3. CONSEQUENCE (Logical, related):
   - "You're distracting others, move to that seat"
   - "You didn't do homework, stay after class to finish"

4. PARENT CONTACT:
   - Call home (not just for bad, also good news!)
   - Document (date, time, what was discussed)

5. REFERRAL (Last resort):
   - Send to dean/admin only if safety issue or repeated defiance
   - Follow school protocol

---

CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS:

DEFIANCE:
- Stay calm (don't escalate)
- Offer choice ("You can do X or Y, you decide")
- Defer if public ("See me after class")
- Follow up privately (build relationship, understand why)

CELL PHONES:
- Consistent policy (take away until end of class, parent picks up, etc.)
- Prevention: Phone caddy (all phones in at start of class)
- Avoid power struggle ("Give me your phone NOW!")
  * "Phones away, or I'll collect them. Your choice."

SIDE CONVERSATIONS:
- Pause, wait (silence gets attention)
- Proximity (stand near talkers)
- Cold call talkers (accountability)

SLEEPING:
- Approach privately ("Are you okay? Do you need water?")
- May be legitimate (work, family issues)
- Offer support, but clear: "You can't sleep in class. If tired, stand in back."

WORK REFUSAL:
- Don't argue
- "This is the expectation. If you choose not to do it, here's the consequence."
- Offer help: "Do you need help getting started?"
- Build relationship outside of conflict (find common interest, show you care)
```

## Assessment & Grading

```markdown
FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT (During learning):

PURPOSE: Check understanding, adjust instruction (not for grade)

STRATEGIES:
- Exit ticket (3-5 min, end of class)
  * Example: "Write 2 things you learned, 1 question you still have"
- Thumbs up/down (quick gauge)
- Whiteboard responses (all students show answer simultaneously)
- Kahoot, Quizizz (game-based)
- Cold call (random, check individuals)

---

SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT (End of unit):

PURPOSE: Measure mastery (for grade)

TYPES:
- Test (multiple choice, short answer, essay)
- Project (presentation, poster, model)
- Essay
- Performance (debate, speech, lab demo)

BEST PRACTICES:
- Align with standards and objectives
- Variety (accommodate different strengths: writing, speaking, creating)
- Clear rubric (students know expectations)
- Retakes (emphasize learning over one-time performance)
  * Option 1: Retake after tutoring/corrections (average two scores)
  * Option 2: Replace original score (prioritize mastery)

---

GRADING:

CATEGORIES:
- Tests/Quizzes (40-50%)
- Homework (10-20%)
- Classwork/Participation (10-20%)
- Projects (20-30%)

LATE WORK:
- Accept late work (learning > deadline)
- Penalty: 10-20% off per day (up to 3 days, then 50% max)
- Or: No penalty, but required to complete (zero until turned in)

EXTRA CREDIT:
- Sparingly (shouldn't replace actual work)
- Enrichment (not just "easy points")
- Example: Attend event, write reflection (1-2% bonus)

ZERO POLICY:
- Avoid zeros (mathematically devastating: 0 vs 60 same as 60 vs 100)
- Alternatives:
  * 50% floor (minimum score, avoids zero but still low)
  * Incomplete (must complete before grade submitted)
  * Retake/redo
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Relationships first** - Students work harder for teachers they like (invest in connections)
2. **Engaging lessons prevent misbehavior** - Boring class = phones out, sleeping, talking
3. **Consistency** - Rules, consequences, grading (predictability builds trust)
4. **Flexibility** - Differentiate, offer choice (one-size-fits-all doesn't work)
5. **Reflect & iterate** - What worked? What didn't? Adjust (teaching is craft, improves over time)
