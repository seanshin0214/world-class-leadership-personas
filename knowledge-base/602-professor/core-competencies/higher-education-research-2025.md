## University Teaching

### Course Design

```markdown
SYLLABUS STRUCTURE:

LOGISTICS:
- Course title & number
- Meeting times & location
- Instructor contact (email, office hours)
- Course website (Canvas, Blackboard)

COURSE DESCRIPTION:
- What is this course about?
- Prerequisites

LEARNING OBJECTIVES (Measurable):
- "By the end of this course, students will be able to..."
- Use Bloom's Taxonomy verbs (analyze, evaluate, create vs "understand")
- Example: "Design and conduct a randomized controlled trial"

REQUIRED MATERIALS:
- Textbook (ISBN, edition)
- Readings (articles, book chapters)
- Software, lab materials

GRADING:
| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Exams (2) | 40% |
| Quizzes | 15% |
| Homework | 20% |
| Final Project | 20% |
| Participation | 5% |

Grading scale: A (90-100%), B (80-89%), etc.

POLICIES:
- Attendance ("Attendance is expected but not graded")
- Late work ("10% penalty per day, max 3 days")
- Academic integrity ("Plagiarism will result in F for course + referral")
- Accommodations ("Students with disabilities should contact ODS")
- Technology use ("Laptops allowed for notes, not social media")

SCHEDULE:
| Week | Topic | Readings | Assignments Due |
|------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Introduction to Psychology | Ch 1 | - |
| 2 | Research Methods | Ch 2, Smith (2023) | Quiz 1 |
| 3 | Neuroscience | Ch 3-4 | HW 1 |

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT (Required):
"All students are expected to uphold the University Honor Code.
Violations include plagiarism, cheating, and unauthorized collaboration.
First offense = F on assignment. Second = F in course."

---

FIRST DAY OF CLASS:

DON'T:
❌ Just read the syllabus (boring, students can read)
❌ Dismiss early (sets bad precedent)
❌ Be intimidating (students won't ask questions)

DO:
✅ Icebreaker activity ("Find someone who has been to 3+ countries")
✅ Explain "why" (Why is this course valuable? Why should they care?)
✅ Start teaching (brief lecture on intriguing topic)
✅ Set expectations (attendance, participation, workload)
✅ Share your "office hours are for you" (encourage visiting)

---

ACTIVE LEARNING (Engagement):

FLIPPED CLASSROOM:
- Pre-class: Students watch lecture video, do readings
- In-class: Discussion, problem-solving, projects
- Benefits: More interaction, deeper learning
- Requires: Student buy-in, accountability (quiz on pre-work)

THINK-PAIR-SHARE:
- Think: "Take 2 minutes to consider..."
- Pair: "Discuss with neighbor..."
- Share: "Who wants to share with class?"

CASE-BASED LEARNING:
- Present real-world scenario (e.g., patient case, business dilemma)
- Students analyze, apply concepts
- Discuss as class

JIGSAW:
- Divide topic into chunks (A, B, C, D)
- Assign students to expert groups (all A's together)
- Regroup into mixed groups (one A, B, C, D per group)
- Each teaches their chunk
- Benefits: Peer teaching, accountability

CLICKERS / POLL EVERYWHERE:
- Multiple choice questions during lecture
- Students respond via app
- See class results instantly (histogrambuiltinmisconceptions)
- Discuss why answers are right/wrong
```

### Difficult Teaching Situations

```markdown
STUDENT CHALLENGES GRADE:
- Listen calmly ("I understand you're frustrated")
- Review assignment with rubric ("Here's why you got 75...")
- Don't change grade on the spot ("I'll review and get back to you")
- Document conversation
- If grade change warranted, do so (but set high bar to avoid flood)

STUDENT CAUGHT CHEATING:
- Meet privately with evidence
- "I noticed your exam answers match [Student B]'s, including same errors"
- Listen to explanation (sometimes innocent - sat too close)
- If intentional: Follow university policy (usually F on assignment + report)
- Document everything (you may need to testify in honor code hearing)

STUDENT ASKS FOR EXTENSION (Again):
- "I see you've requested 3 extensions this semester. What's going on?"
- If legitimate (family emergency, medical): Grant with documentation
- If time management: Offer study skills workshop, but no extension
- Be consistent (if you grant one, word spreads)

STUDENT EMAILS AT 11 PM, EXPECTS IMMEDIATE REPLY:
- Set boundaries in syllabus: "I respond to emails within 24 hours M-F"
- Auto-reply: "I've received your email and will respond within 24 hours"
- Don't enable 24/7 availability (protect your time)

STUDENT DOESN'T PARTICIPATE:
- Call on them occasionally (not maliciously, supportively)
- "Alex, what do you think?" → If they don't know: "That's okay, turn to partner and discuss"
- Grade participation (some students need extrinsic motivation)
- Private conversation: "I noticed you're quiet. How can I support you?"
```

PEER REVIEW PROCESS:

1. SUBMIT:
   - Upload manuscript, figures, supplementary data
   - Suggest reviewers (3-5 experts in field)

2. EDITOR REVIEW (1-2 weeks):
   - Desk reject if out of scope or poor quality (~30%)
   - If passes: Send to 2-3 peer reviewers

3. PEER REVIEW (4-12 weeks):
   - Experts evaluate:
     * Novelty
     * Methods (rigorous?)
     * Results (support conclusions?)
     * Writing quality

4. DECISION:
   - Accept (rare on first submission, <5%)
   - Minor revisions (good! Small changes)
   - Major revisions (extensive changes, re-review)
   - Reject (try another journal)

5. REVISE & RESUBMIT:
   - Address every reviewer comment
   - "Thank you for your insightful comments..."
   - Point-by-point response document
   - Highlight changes in manuscript

6. ACCEPT & PUBLISH:
   - Proofs (final check before publication)
   - Online first, then print

TIMELINE: 6-18 months (submission → publication)

---

DEALING WITH REJECTION:

- Normal! Even Nobel laureates get rejected
- Read reviews carefully (often valuable feedback)
- Revise and submit to another journal
- Don't argue with reviewers (even if wrong - just resubmit elsewhere)
- Thick skin required
```

## Advising Students

### PhD Student Mentorship

```markdown
RECRUITING STUDENTS:

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
✅ Research interest alignment
✅ Self-motivated (PhD is marathon, not sprint)
✅ Strong fundamentals (math, coding, writing)
✅ Coachable (takes feedback well)
❌ Expects hand-holding
❌ Just wants "Dr." title (won't finish)

INTERVIEW:
- Discuss research interests (theirs & yours)
- "Why PhD? Why this lab?"
- "Tell me about a challenging project you completed"
- Give realistic preview (hard work, long hours, setbacks)
- Mutual fit assessment

---

PhD MILESTONES (Timeline):

YEAR 1:
- Coursework
- Lab rotations (if applicable)
- Choose advisor by end of year

YEAR 2:
- Finish coursework
- Qualifying exam (written + oral)
- Identify dissertation topic

YEAR 3-4:
- Conduct research
- Publish 1-2 papers
- Proposal defense (dissertation plan)

YEAR 5-6:
- Complete research
- Dissertation writing
- Dissertation defense
- Publish 2-3 more papers
- Apply for postdocs/jobs

---

WEEKLY MEETINGS (1-on-1):

STRUCTURE:
- Student presents progress (30 min)
  * What did you accomplish this week?
  * What challenges did you face?
  * What's the plan for next week?
- Discuss roadblocks, brainstorm solutions
- Review figures, writing
- Set goals for next week

RED FLAGS:
🚩 Student avoids meetings
🚩 No progress for multiple weeks
🚩 Vague updates ("Working on X...")
🚩 Mental health decline

→ Address early, don't let issues fester

---

WHEN STUDENTS STRUGGLE:

RESEARCH STALL:
- Break down into smaller tasks (overwhelm → specific steps)
- Pair with senior student (peer mentorship)
- Revisit project scope (too ambitious?)

MENTAL HEALTH:
- "I noticed you seem stressed. How are you doing?"
- Refer to university counseling services
- Flexible schedule if needed
- Normalize seeking help ("Many students use counseling")

THINKING OF QUITTING:
- Listen without judgment
- Explore reasons (Is it fixable? Different project? Leave academia?)
- PhD isn't for everyone - Master's is okay too
- Support their decision (don't guilt into staying)
```

## Work-Life Balance (or Lack Thereof)

```markdown
TYPICAL PROFESSOR WORKLOAD:

TEACHING (30-40%):
- Lecture prep (2-3 hours per hour of lecture for new course)
- Grading (exams, papers, projects)
- Office hours
- Student emails

RESEARCH (40-50%):
- Grant writing (constant!)
- Conducting experiments, analyzing data
- Writing papers
- Advising students

SERVICE (10-20%):
- Committees (hiring, curriculum, promotions)
- Peer review (10-20 papers/year)
- Conference organizing

TOTAL HOURS: 50-70 hours/week

---

STRATEGIES TO SURVIVE:

TIME BLOCKING:
- Writing: Monday & Wednesday mornings (protect this time!)
- Teaching prep: Tuesday afternoons
- Meetings: Thursday-Friday
- Email: 3x/day (9am, 1pm, 4pm) - not constantly

LEARN TO SAY NO:
- Committees: 2-3 max (say no to rest)
- Peer review: Limit to 10-15/year
- External requests: "Thank you, but my plate is full"

BOUNDARIES:
- No work after 7pm (family time)
- No work Saturdays (recharge)
- Vacation = actual vacation (not working from beach)

DELEGATE:
- TA can grade exams
- Senior PhD student can mentor junior students
- Research assistant can collect data

EFFICIENCY:
- Recycle content (lectures, slides improve each year)
- Templates (grant budgets, IRB applications)
- Batch tasks (grade all exams in one sitting)
```
