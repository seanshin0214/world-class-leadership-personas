## Classroom Management

```markdown
PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES:

CLEAR EXPECTATIONS:
- Establish rules on Day 1
- 3-5 rules (simple, positive)
- Examples:
  * "Respect others and their property"
  * "Follow directions the first time"
  * "Keep hands, feet, and objects to yourself"
  * "Raise hand before speaking"

CO-CREATE with students:
- "What should our classroom look like to learn best?"
- Ownership → Better compliance

POST VISUALLY:
- Anchor chart on wall
- Refer back when needed

---

ROUTINES & PROCEDURES:

ENTRANCE ROUTINE:
1. Enter quietly
2. Unpack backpack
3. Turn in homework (designated basket)
4. Start bell ringer (warm-up on board)

TRANSITIONS:
- Timer (5-minute warning, "2 minutes left")
- Attention signal (clap pattern, chime, "Give me 5")
- Practice transitions (time how fast class can clean up)

ATTENTION SIGNALS:
- "Class class" → "Yes yes"
- Clap pattern (teacher claps, students echo)
- Hand raised (students see, raise theirs, quiet down)
- Countdown (5-4-3-2-1, silence by 1)

---

SEATING ARRANGEMENTS:

ROWS:
- Traditional
- Good for: Tests, independent work
- Bad for: Collaboration

GROUPS (4-6 students):
- Face each other
- Good for: Group work, discussions
- Bad for: Can be distracting

U-SHAPE:
- Students in U, teacher in center
- Good for: Class discussions, seeing all students
- Bad for: Groupwork (students not facing each other)

FLEXIBLE:
- Mix (some individual desks, some tables, some standing desks)
- Students choose based on task
- Good for: Differentiation, student autonomy

STRATEGIC PLACEMENT:
- Behavior issues: Near teacher, separated
- Low vision: Front row
- Hearing impaired: Front, center
- Mix high/low achievers (peer tutoring)

---

POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT:

SPECIFIC PRAISE:
❌ "Good job"
✅ "I love how you used evidence from the text to support your answer"

BEHAVIOR-SPECIFIC:
❌ "Great work today"
✅ "Thank you for raising your hand before speaking"

PUBLIC vs PRIVATE:
- Public: Motivates others ("Table 3 is ready!")
- Private: Builds relationship (quiet word of encouragement)

REWARD SYSTEMS:
- Class Dojo (digital points)
- Marble jar (whole class goal)
- Sticker charts (elementary)
- Verbal praise (most powerful, free!)

CAUTION:
- Don't over-rely on extrinsic rewards
- Goal: Intrinsic motivation (pride in work, not just stickers)

---

CONSEQUENCES:

PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE:
1. Warning (verbal reminder)
2. Loss of privilege (no free time)
3. Time-out (5 min in corner or buddy room)
4. Parent contact
5. Office referral (admin)

LOGICAL CONSEQUENCES:
- Mess = Clean up
- Break = Fix or replace
- Disrupt = Lose privilege

AVOID:
- Whole class punishment (unfair to well-behaved students)
- Yelling (loses effectiveness, damages relationship)
- Power struggles ("Because I said so" → "I understand you're frustrated, but...")

RESTORATIVE PRACTICES:
- "What happened?"
- "Who was affected?"
- "How can you make it right?"
- Goal: Repair harm, not just punish

## Lesson Planning

```markdown
MADELINE HUNTER MODEL:

1. ANTICIPATORY SET (Hook, 5 min):
   - Grab attention
   - Activate prior knowledge
   - Example: "Turn to partner, share one thing you know about photosynthesis"

2. LEARNING OBJECTIVE (1 min):
   - State what students will learn
   - "By the end of class, you'll be able to explain the process of photosynthesis"
   - Write on board, say aloud

3. INPUT (Direct Instruction, 10-15 min):
   - Teach new content
   - Lecture, video, demonstration
   - Chunk info (10 min max before activity)

4. MODELING (I Do, 5-10 min):
   - Demonstrate skill
   - Think aloud
   - Example: "Watch how I solve this problem. First, I..."

5. GUIDED PRACTICE (We Do, 10-15 min):
   - Students practice with support
   - Example: Whole class solves problem together
   - Teacher circulates, corrects mistakes

6. CHECK FOR UNDERSTANDING (CFU):
   - Thumbs up/down
   - Exit ticket
   - Whiteboard responses (all students show answers simultaneously)

7. INDEPENDENT PRACTICE (You Do, 10-20 min):
   - Students work alone
   - Worksheet, essay, project
   - Teacher monitors, assists struggling students

8. CLOSURE (5 min):
   - Summarize learning
   - "What did we learn today?"
   - Preview tomorrow
   - Quick formative assessment

---

GRADUAL RELEASE OF RESPONSIBILITY:

I DO → WE DO → YOU DO (TOGETHER) → YOU DO (ALONE)

Example (Teaching Paragraph Writing):
1. I DO: Teacher writes paragraph on board, thinking aloud
2. WE DO: Class writes paragraph together (teacher facilitates)
3. YOU DO TOGETHER: Partner pairs write paragraph
4. YOU DO ALONE: Individual paragraph

---

DIFFERENTIATION:

CONTENT (What students learn):
- Advanced: Read chapter book
- On-level: Read adapted text
- Struggling: Read picture book

PROCESS (How students learn):
- Visual learners: Graphic organizers
- Auditory: Podcast, discussion
- Kinesthetic: Hands-on activity

PRODUCT (How students show learning):
- Essay
- Presentation
- Poster
- Video
- Podcast

CHOICE BOARDS (3×3 grid, student picks 3):
┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐
│ Write song │ Draw poster│ Build model│
├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤
│ Record vid │ MUST DO    │ Write essay│
├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤
│ Interview  │ Timeline   │ Skit       │

## Student Engagement

```markdown
WAIT TIME:

PROBLEM: Teacher asks question, calls on first hand (after 1 second)

SOLUTION:
1. Ask question
2. WAIT 3-5 seconds (silently!)
3. Call on student

BENEFITS:
- More students think (not just fast processors)
- Deeper answers
- More participation

---

EQUITY STICKS:

PROBLEM: Same 5 students always raise hands

SOLUTION:
- Popsicle sticks with student names
- Pull stick randomly
- Everyone must be ready to answer
- Return stick or set aside (depends on preference)

---

THINK-PAIR-SHARE:

1. THINK (30 sec-1 min):
   - Individual thinking time
   - "What caused the Civil War?"

2. PAIR (2 min):
   - Turn to partner, discuss

3. SHARE (5 min):
   - Pairs share with class
   - Teacher calls on 3-5 pairs

BENEFITS:
- 100% participation (vs 1 student if just cold-calling)
- Rehearsal before sharing (less intimidating)
- Peer learning

---

COOPERATIVE LEARNING:

JIGSAW:
1. Divide topic into 4 parts
2. Students become "expert" in 1 part (expert groups)
3. Return to home groups, teach each other

NUMBERED HEADS TOGETHER:
1. Groups of 4, numbered 1-4
2. Teacher asks question
3. "Put your heads together" (discuss)
4. Teacher calls number (e.g., "3s stand and answer")
5. All 3s answer (accountability)

KAGAN STRUCTURES:
- Rally Robin (partners alternate answers)
- Round Robin (group takes turns)
- Timed Pair Share (1 min each, switch)

---

TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION:

KAHOOT (Quiz game):
- Multiple choice questions
- Leaderboard (competitive)
- Immediate feedback
- Fun music, colors

NEARPOD (Interactive lessons):
- Embedded quizzes, polls
- Draw responses
- VR field trips

FLIPGRID (Video discussions):
- Students record video responses
- Comment on peers' videos
- Shy students often more comfortable

GOOGLE CLASSROOM:
- Assign, collect, grade digitally
- Feedback (comments, rubrics)
- Parent access
```

---

## Assessment

```markdown
FORMATIVE (During learning, low-stakes):

EXIT TICKET:
- Last 5 min of class
- 1-3 questions on notecard
- Example: "What's the main idea of today's lesson?"
- Teacher reviews, adjusts next day's lesson

THUMBS UP/DOWN:
- Quick check: "Thumbs up if you understand, thumbs down if confused"
- Not graded, just gauge understanding

WHITEBOARDS:
- Each student has small whiteboard
- Teacher asks question
- All students write answer, hold up
- Teacher sees all answers simultaneously (not just one student)

RUNNING RECORD:
- Teacher observes student reading aloud
- Marks errors
- Calculates accuracy, fluency
- Determines reading level

---

SUMMATIVE (End of unit, graded):

TEST/QUIZ:
- Multiple choice, short answer, essay
- Measures mastery of learning objectives

PROJECT:
- Research paper
- Presentation
- Science fair

PERFORMANCE TASK:
- Authentic assessment
- Example: "Design a city that solves water shortage"
- Rubric (criteria: research, design, presentation)

PORTFOLIO:
- Collection of student work over time
- Shows growth
- Student reflection

---

GRADING:

STANDARDS-BASED GRADING:
- Grade by learning objective (not one overall grade)
- Example:
  * Reading comprehension: 3/4 (proficient)
  * Writing: 2/4 (developing)
  * Speaking: 4/4 (advanced)

RUBRIC:
┌────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┐
│Criteria│ 1 (F)  │ 2 (D)  │ 3 (B)  │ 4 (A)  │
├────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┤
│Content │Missing │Basic   │Good    │Excellent│
│        │key pts │info    │detail  │depth   │
├────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┤
│Writing │Many    │Some    │Few     │No      │
│        │errors  │errors  │errors  │errors  │
└────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┘

FEEDBACK:
- Specific: "Your thesis is clear, but add more evidence in paragraph 2"
- Actionable: "Next time, cite 3 sources instead of 1"
- Timely: Return within 1 week (while still relevant)

---

GROWTH MINDSET (Carol Dweck):

FIXED: "I'm bad at math"
GROWTH: "I'm not good at this YET"

FIXED: "This is too hard"
GROWTH: "This will take time and effort"

TEACHER LANGUAGE:
❌ "You're so smart!"
✅ "I can see you worked really hard on this"

❌ "Some people are just good at math"
✅ "Everyone can improve with practice"

PRAISE EFFORT, STRATEGY, PROGRESS (not innate ability)
```

## Culturally Responsive Teaching

```markdown
PRINCIPLES:

KNOW YOUR STUDENTS:
- Surveys (interests, family, culture)
- Home visits (if appropriate)
- Community events

CULTURALLY RELEVANT CONTENT:
- Diverse authors (not just white, male, Western)
- Multicultural examples
- Students see themselves in curriculum

LEVERAGE ASSETS:
- Bilingual students: Asset, not deficit
- Different cultures: Rich background knowledge
- "Funds of knowledge" (family expertise)

HIGH EXPECTATIONS:
- All students can achieve (with support)
- Don't lower bar, provide scaffolding

COMMUNITY:
- Classroom as family
- Collaborative > competitive
- Value collectivism (not just individualism)
```
