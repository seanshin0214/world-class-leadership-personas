- Best for: Science experiments, investigations
- Example: "What happens if we change X?"

COOPERATIVE LEARNING:
- Small group work (3-5 students)
- Interdependence (everyone contributes)
- Best for: Projects, discussions
- Structures: Jigsaw, Think-Pair-Share

DIFFERENTIATION:

CONTENT (What is taught):
- Tiered reading materials (below/on/above grade level)
- Different complexity of problems

PROCESS (How it's taught):
- Visual learners: Diagrams, videos
- Kinesthetic learners: Hands-on activities
- Auditory learners: Discussions, podcasts

PRODUCT (How students demonstrate learning):
- Essay, poster, presentation, video, model
- Choice boards (student choice)

LEARNING ENVIRONMENT:
- Flexible seating
- Quiet space for individual work
- Collaboration areas for group work

---

UDL (Universal Design for Learning):

MULTIPLE MEANS OF REPRESENTATION:
- Present information in various ways
- Text, audio, video, diagrams

MULTIPLE MEANS OF ENGAGEMENT:
- Tap into interests
- Choices, relevance, challenge level

MULTIPLE MEANS OF EXPRESSION:
- Allow different ways to show learning
- Writing, speaking, creating, performing
```

## Assessment Design

```markdown
TYPES OF ASSESSMENT:

DIAGNOSTIC (Pre-assessment):
- Before instruction
- Identify prior knowledge, misconceptions
- Example: Pre-test, KWL chart (Know, Want to know, Learned)

FORMATIVE (During instruction):
- Check for understanding
- Adjust teaching based on results
- NOT graded (low stakes)
- Examples:
  * Exit tickets
  * Thumbs up/down
  * Mini-whiteboard responses
  * Kahoot quiz

SUMMATIVE (After instruction):
- Measure achievement of objectives
- Graded (high stakes)
- Examples:
  * Unit test
  * Final project
  * Essay
  * Presentation

---

ASSESSMENT FORMATS:

SELECTED RESPONSE:
- Multiple choice, true/false, matching
- Pros: Easy to grade, objective
- Cons: Can't assess higher-order thinking
- Good for: Recall, comprehension

CONSTRUCTED RESPONSE:
- Short answer, essay
- Pros: Assess deeper understanding
- Cons: Time to grade, subjective
- Good for: Analysis, evaluation

PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT:
- Demonstrate skill
- Examples: Lab, presentation, debate, art project
- Rubric needed for consistency

PORTFOLIO:
- Collection of work over time
- Shows growth & progress
- Student reflection component

---

TEST DESIGN TIPS:

MULTIPLE CHOICE:
✅ Clear stem (question)
✅ Plausible distractors
✅ Avoid "all of the above" / "none of the above"
❌ Trick questions

Example:
Which is a renewable energy source?
A. Coal
B. Natural gas
C. Solar ✓
D. Petroleum

ESSAY QUESTIONS:
✅ Specific prompt
✅ Clear expectations (length, format)
✅ Rubric provided

Example:
"Compare and contrast the causes of WWI and WWII. 
In your essay (500 words):
- Identify 3 similarities
- Identify 3 differences
- Provide specific historical evidence
Use the rubric provided."

SHORT ANSWER:
✅ What specifically do you want?
❌ "What is photosynthesis?" (too broad)
✅ "Describe the two stages of photosynthesis and 
    where each occurs in the chloroplast." (specific)

## Alignment

```markdown
STANDARDS ALIGNMENT:

Common Core ELA Example:
CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.8.2
"Determine a theme or central idea of a text"

ALIGNED OBJECTIVE:
"Students will identify the theme of 'The Gift of the Magi' 
by analyzing character actions and plot events."

ALIGNED ASSESSMENT:
"Write a paragraph explaining the theme of the story. 
Use 2 examples from the text to support your claim."

ALIGNED INSTRUCTION:
- Direct teach: What is theme? (vs topic)
- Model: Analyze 'The Necklace' together
- Guided practice: Small groups analyze 'The Gift of the Magi'
- Independent: Write theme paragraph

---

VERTICAL ALIGNMENT:

Grade 5: Identify theme in simple texts
↓
Grade 6: Analyze how theme is developed
↓
Grade 7: Compare themes across texts
↓
Grade 8: Analyze complex themes & symbolism

→ Build on prior knowledge, increase complexity

---

HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT:

All 8th grade ELA teachers teach same standards
→ Common assessments (fair comparison)
→ Share resources, best practices
→ Consistent expectations
```

---

1. Were objectives achieved?
   - Compare pre-test to post-test
   - 80% of students met standard?

2. Were learning experiences effective?
   - Student feedback surveys
   - Observation data

3. Were materials appropriate?
   - Text complexity suitable?
   - Engaging and relevant?

4. Was assessment valid?
   - Did it measure what it claimed?
   - Reliable (consistent results)?

---

DATA SOURCES:

STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT:
- Test scores, grades
- Growth over time
- Comparison to benchmarks

STUDENT ENGAGEMENT:
- Attendance, participation
- Student surveys

---

REVISION PROCESS:

1. COLLECT DATA (End of year)
2. ANALYZE (What patterns emerge?)
3. IDENTIFY GAPS (Where did students struggle?)
4. REVISE (Update objectives, materials, assessments)
5. PILOT (Try changes with small group)
6. IMPLEMENT (Roll out to all)
7. REPEAT (Continuous improvement)
```

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Backward design** - Start with end goals, plan backwards
2. **Alignment** - Objectives → Instruction → Assessment (all match)
3. **Differentiation** - One size doesn't fit all
4. **Data-driven** - Use assessment data to improve
5. **Student-centered** - Design for learner needs, not convenience
