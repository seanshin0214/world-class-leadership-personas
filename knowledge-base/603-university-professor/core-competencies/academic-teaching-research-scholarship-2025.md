## Course Design

```markdown
BACKWARD DESIGN (Wiggins & McTighe):

STAGE 1: IDENTIFY DESIRED RESULTS
- Learning outcomes (what students should know/do by end of course)
- SMART objectives (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Bloom's Taxonomy levels:
  * Remember, Understand (Lower-order)
  * Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create (Higher-order thinking)

EXAMPLE (Statistics course):
- "Students will be able to conduct and interpret a multiple regression analysis" (Apply)
- "Students will be able to evaluate limitations of correlation vs causation" (Evaluate)

STAGE 2: DETERMINE ACCEPTABLE EVIDENCE
- Assessments (how to measure learning)
- Formative (low-stakes, during semester: quizzes, discussions)
- Summative (high-stakes, end: exams, papers, projects)
- Authentic assessment (real-world application, not just memorization)

STAGE 3: PLAN LEARNING EXPERIENCES
- Lectures, discussions, labs, fieldwork
- Scaffold (build complexity over semester)
- Active learning (not passive lecture)

---

SYLLABUS DESIGN:

REQUIRED COMPONENTS:
- Course title, number, credits, semester
- Instructor contact (email, office hours, response time)
- Prerequisites
- Course description (catalog description + expanded)
- Learning outcomes (3-5 measurable outcomes)
- Required texts/materials
- Grading breakdown (exams 40%, papers 30%, participation 20%, etc.)
- Course schedule (week-by-week topics, readings, due dates)
- Policies:
  * Attendance (required? excused absences?)
  * Late work (penalty? accepted?)
  * Academic integrity (plagiarism consequences)
  * Accommodations (students with disabilities, contact Accessibility Services)

BEST PRACTICES:
- Clear expectations (grading criteria, participation requirements)
- Flexibility (unexpected events, adjust as needed)
- Tone (welcoming, supportive, not punitive)
- Accessibility statement (invite students to disclose needs)

---

GRADING PHILOSOPHY:

CRITERION-REFERENCED (Mastery-based):
- Grade based on meeting standards (not curve)
- A = Excellent (90-100%), B = Good (80-89%), etc.
- Student learns content to A level = earns A (even if all students get A)

NORM-REFERENCED (Curve):
- Grade based on class distribution (top 10% = A, next 20% = B, etc.)
- Competition (your grade depends on others' performance)
- Common in large lectures, STEM

UNGRADING:
- Minimize points, focus on feedback
- Students reflect, self-assess
- Final grade: negotiated or portfolio-based
- Goal: Intrinsic motivation (not chasing points)

RUBRICS:
- Clear criteria (what constitutes A, B, C work)
- Analytic rubric (separate criteria: argument, evidence, writing)
- Holistic rubric (overall impression)
- Share with students (transparency, reduce grade disputes)

EXAMPLE (Essay rubric):
| Criteria | Excellent (A) | Good (B) | Satisfactory (C) | Poor (D/F) |
|----------|---------------|----------|------------------|------------|
| Argument | Clear, original thesis | Clear thesis | Vague thesis | No thesis |
| Evidence | Strong, relevant | Adequate | Weak | Missing |
| Writing | Clear, error-free | Mostly clear, few errors | Unclear, many errors | Incomprehensible |

## Teaching Methods

```markdown
LECTURE:

TRADITIONAL:
- Instructor talks, students listen (passive)
- Effective for: Conveying information, large classes

ACTIVE LECTURE:
- Pause every 10-15 min (attention span)
- Think-pair-share (30 sec think, 2 min pair discussion, 3 min share)
- Clickers/polls (Mentimeter, Poll Everywhere - gauge understanding)
- Mini-activities (work problem, discuss with neighbor)

TIPS:
- Storytelling (engage emotion, memorable)
- Visuals (images, diagrams, not text-heavy slides)
- Pause for questions (create safe space, "This is confusing, let's unpack")
- Record lectures (post for review, accessibility)

---

DISCUSSION-BASED:

SOCRATIC SEMINAR:
- Student-led (instructor facilitates, not lectures)
- Pre-assigned reading/question
- Inner circle discusses, outer circle observes
- Emphasize: Build on others' ideas, cite text

FISHBOWL:
- Inner circle discusses, outer circle listens
- Swap halfway
- Benefit: All students engage (not just talkative few)

QUESTIONING TECHNIQUES:
- Open-ended ("What do you think? Why?")
- Wait time (5-10 sec after asking, before calling on student)
- Follow-up ("Can you say more?" "Does anyone want to add?")
- Avoid: Yes/no questions, leading questions

MANAGING:
- Ground rules (respect, one speaker, no interruptions)
- Cold call (equity sticks, ensure all participate)
- Encourage quiet students ("We haven't heard from [name], thoughts?")
- Redirect tangents ("Interesting, but let's refocus on [topic]")

---

FLIPPED CLASSROOM:

MODEL:
- Pre-class: Watch lecture videos, read (asynchronous)
- In-class: Active learning (discussion, problem-solving, projects)
- Benefit: Use class time for high-value activities (not passive lecture)

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Record 10-15 min videos (not full lecture, key concepts)
- Assign pre-class quiz (ensure students watched/read)
- Design in-class activities (apply concepts)

CHALLENGES:
- Students don't prepare (enforce accountability: quiz, participation grade)
- Time-intensive (create videos, design activities)

---

EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING:

TYPES:
- Service learning (community project, reflection)
- Internships (field experience)
- Labs (hands-on, scientific inquiry)
- Simulations (role-play, case studies)

EXAMPLE (Business ethics course):
- Case study: Company faces ethical dilemma
- Groups: Stakeholder perspectives (CEO, employees, customers, community)
- Debate: What should company do? (Apply ethical frameworks)

---

INCLUSIVE TEACHING:

UNIVERSAL DESIGN FOR LEARNING (UDL):
- Multiple means of representation (text, audio, video, diagrams)
- Multiple means of engagement (choice, relevance, challenge)
- Multiple means of expression (essay, presentation, video, podcast)

CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE:
- Diversify curriculum (authors, perspectives, not just "dead white men")
- Acknowledge positionality (your bias, privilege)
- Create belonging (pronouns, land acknowledgment, diverse examples)

ACCESSIBILITY:
- Captions (videos)
- Alt text (images)
- Accessible PDFs (screen reader compatible)
- Flexible deadlines (accommodate disabilities, emergencies)
```

## Research Methodology

```markdown
RESEARCH PROCESS:

1. IDENTIFY RESEARCH QUESTION:
   - Gap in literature (what's unknown?)
   - Specific, answerable
   - Example: "How does social media use affect adolescent mental health?"

2. LITERATURE REVIEW:
   - Search databases (Google Scholar, JSTOR, PubMed)
   - Read seminal works, recent articles (last 5 years)
   - Synthesize (themes, debates, gaps)
   - Develop theoretical framework

3. RESEARCH DESIGN:
   - Quantitative (numbers, statistics, surveys, experiments)
   - Qualitative (words, interviews, ethnography, case studies)
   - Mixed methods (both)

4. DATA COLLECTION:
   - Surveys (online, Qualtrics)
   - Interviews (in-depth, semi-structured)
   - Observations (participant, non-participant)
   - Archival research (documents, historical records)
   - Experiments (control, treatment groups)

5. DATA ANALYSIS:
   - Quantitative: Statistical analysis (SPSS, R, Python)
     * Descriptive (mean, median, SD)
     * Inferential (t-test, ANOVA, regression)
   - Qualitative: Coding (themes, patterns, NVivo, ATLAS.ti)
     * Open coding (identify concepts)
     * Axial coding (categories, relationships)
     * Selective coding (core theme)

6. WRITE UP:
   - Structure: Introduction → Literature Review → Methods → Results → Discussion → Conclusion
   - Figures, tables (visualize data)
   - Cite sources (APA, MLA, Chicago)

7. SUBMIT FOR PUBLICATION:
   - Choose journal (scope, impact factor, audience)
   - Peer review (2-6 months, revise & resubmit)
   - Publish (open access or paywalled)

---

RESEARCH ETHICS:

INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB):
- Required for human subjects research
- Review protocol (minimize harm, protect privacy)
- Informed consent (participants know risks, can withdraw)
- Exemptions: Publicly available data, educational research (low risk)

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:
- No plagiarism (cite all sources)
- No data fabrication/falsification
- Disclose conflicts of interest
- Authorship credit (significant contribution only)
- Reproducibility (share data, code when possible)
```
