## Research Designs

```markdown
QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH:

EXPERIMENTAL (Gold standard):
- Random assignment to groups
- Manipulate independent variable
- Measure effect on dependent variable
- Establishes causation

Example:
- Research question: Does caffeine improve memory?
- Design: Randomize participants to caffeine vs placebo
- Measure: Memory test scores
- Control: Double-blind, matched groups

---

QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL:
- No random assignment (naturally occurring groups)
- Example: Compare memory in coffee drinkers vs non-drinkers
- Limitation: Can't establish causation (confounds)

---

CORRELATIONAL:
- Measure two variables, examine relationship
- Example: Relationship between sleep hours and GPA
- Result: Correlation coefficient (r = -1 to +1)
- Limitation: Correlation ≠ causation

---

SURVEY RESEARCH:
- Self-report questionnaires
- Large sample sizes (100-1000+)
- Example: Political opinion polls
- Types: Cross-sectional (one time) vs Longitudinal (repeated)

---

QUALITATIVE RESEARCH:

ETHNOGRAPHY:
- Immersion in culture/community
- Participant observation
- Field notes, interviews
- Example: Study of online gaming communities

PHENOMENOLOGY:
- Lived experiences of individuals
- In-depth interviews (5-25 participants)
- Example: Experience of chronic pain

GROUNDED THEORY:
- Develop theory from data (inductive)
- Iterative coding & analysis
- Example: Process of career change

CASE STUDY:
- In-depth analysis of single case
- Multiple data sources
- Example: Organizational transformation
```

## Sampling

```markdown
PROBABILITY SAMPLING (Generalizable):

SIMPLE RANDOM:
- Every member has equal chance
- Example: Lottery, random number generator
- Pros: Unbiased
- Cons: Requires complete list, may miss subgroups

STRATIFIED RANDOM:
- Divide population into strata (age, gender, etc.)
- Random sample from each stratum
- Pros: Ensures representation
- Cons: More complex

CLUSTER:
- Randomly select clusters (schools, cities)
- Sample all within selected clusters
- Pros: Cost-effective for geographically dispersed
- Cons: Less precise

---

NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLING (Not generalizable):

CONVENIENCE:
- Whoever is available
- Example: College students (WEIRD: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic)
- Pros: Easy, cheap
- Cons: Biased, not generalizable

SNOWBALL:
- Participants recruit others
- Example: Hard-to-reach populations (drug users)
- Pros: Access hidden populations
- Cons: Biased network

PURPOSIVE:
- Intentionally select specific participants
- Example: Experts in field
- Pros: Information-rich cases
- Cons: Not representative

---

SAMPLE SIZE:

QUANTITATIVE:
- Statistical power analysis (G*Power)
- Factors: Effect size, alpha (0.05), power (0.80)
- Typical: 30-100 per group (experiments)

QUALITATIVE:
- Saturation (no new themes emerging)
- Typical: 5-25 participants (interviews)
- More for ethnography (ongoing)
```

## Data Collection

```markdown
SURVEYS:

QUESTION TYPES:

CLOSED-ENDED:
- Multiple choice: "Age: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44..."
- Likert scale: "1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree)"
- Yes/No: "Do you own a car?"

Pros: Easy to analyze, quantifiable
Cons: Limited depth

OPEN-ENDED:
- "Describe your experience with..."
- Pros: Rich detail, unexpected insights
- Cons: Time-consuming to analyze

QUESTION WORDING:

BAD:
❌ Leading: "Don't you think X is bad?"
❌ Double-barreled: "Do you like apples and oranges?"
❌ Jargon: "Do you experience comorbid conditions?"

GOOD:
✅ Neutral: "What is your opinion on X?"
✅ Single topic: "Do you like apples?"
✅ Clear: "Do you have other health conditions?"

RESPONSE RATE:
- Online: 10-30%
- Mail: 20-40%
- Phone: 30-50%
- Face-to-face: 70-90%

Increase rates: Incentives ($5-$25), follow-ups, personalization

---

INTERVIEWS:

STRUCTURE:

STRUCTURED:
- Fixed questions, same order
- Example: Diagnostic interview (DSM-5)
- Pros: Consistent, comparable
- Cons: Inflexible

SEMI-STRUCTURED:
- Guide with key questions
- Flexibility to probe
- Example: Qualitative research interviews
- Pros: Balance structure & flexibility

UNSTRUCTURED:
- Open conversation
- Example: Exploratory research
- Pros: Natural, deep insights
- Cons: Hard to analyze

TIPS:
- Open-ended questions ("Tell me about...")
- Probes ("Can you say more?", "What happened next?")
- Active listening (silence is okay!)
- Record & transcribe (with permission)
- Duration: 30-90 minutes

---

OBSERVATION:

PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION:
- Researcher becomes part of group
- Field notes: What, when, where, who, how
- Example: Ethnography of hospital ward

NON-PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION:
- Researcher observes from outside
- Example: Classroom behavior study
- Structured: Coding scheme (count behaviors)
- Unstructured: Narrative description
```

## Data Analysis

```markdown
QUANTITATIVE:

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS:
- Mean, median, mode (central tendency)
- Standard deviation (variability)
- Frequency distributions

Example:
Ages: 22, 24, 25, 25, 26, 28, 30
Mean: 25.7
Median: 25
Mode: 25
SD: 2.5

INFERENTIAL STATISTICS:

T-TEST:
- Compare two group means
- Example: Caffeine group vs placebo group memory scores
- Result: t(58) = 3.42, p < .01 (significant difference)

ANOVA:
- Compare 3+ group means
- Example: Low, medium, high caffeine doses
- Result: F(2, 87) = 5.23, p < .01

CORRELATION:
- Relationship between two variables
- Pearson's r: -1 to +1
  * +1: Perfect positive (sleep ↑, GPA ↑)
  * 0: No relationship
  * -1: Perfect negative (stress ↑, GPA ↓)
- Example: r = .45, p < .001 (moderate positive)

REGRESSION:
- Predict outcome from predictors
- Example: GPA predicted by sleep, study hours, stress
- Result: R² = .35 (35% of variance explained)

EFFECT SIZE:
- Cohen's d: Small (0.2), Medium (0.5), Large (0.8)
- Important! p-value doesn't indicate magnitude

QUALITATIVE:

THEMATIC ANALYSIS:

1. TRANSCRIPTION:
   - Verbatim transcripts
   - Include pauses, laughter (if relevant)

2. FAMILIARIZATION:
   - Read & re-read transcripts
   - Note initial impressions

3. CODING:
   - Label segments of text
   - Example: "Lack of support", "Financial stress"
   - Use software: NVivo, MAXQDA, ATLAS.ti

4. THEME DEVELOPMENT:
   - Group codes into themes
   - Example theme: "Barriers to treatment"
     * Codes: Cost, stigma, lack of access

5. REVIEW THEMES:
   - Check themes fit data
   - Refine, merge, split

6. DEFINE THEMES:
   - Clear definition of each theme
   - Select representative quotes

7. WRITE-UP:
   - Narrative with quotes
   - Example:
     "Participants reported financial barriers:
     'I couldn't afford the copays' (P3).
     'Insurance denied coverage' (P7)."

INTER-RATER RELIABILITY:
- Two coders independently code 20% of data
- Cohen's kappa: > 0.70 (acceptable)
