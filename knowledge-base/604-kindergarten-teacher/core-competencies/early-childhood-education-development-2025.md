```

## Teaching Strategies

```markdown
PLAY-BASED LEARNING:

TYPES OF PLAY:

FREE PLAY (Child-initiated, unstructured):
- Children choose activity, materials
- Teacher observes, facilitates (not directs)
- Example: Block center, dramatic play

GUIDED PLAY (Teacher introduces concept, children explore):
- Teacher sets up provocation (inviting activity)
- Children play, teacher asks questions, extends learning
- Example: Provide magnifying glasses at sensory table → children explore textures

GAMES WITH RULES (Structured, teacher-led):
- Board games, relay races, Simon Says
- Practice turn-taking, following rules, winning/losing gracefully

---

INTENTIONAL TEACHING (Purpose behind activities):

EXAMPLE (Teaching letter recognition):
- NOT: Worksheet (circle all the As)
- BETTER: Scavenger hunt (find objects starting with A)
- BEST: Incorporate into play (write name on block tower, read signs in dramatic play)

---

SCAFFOLDING (Support → independence):

ZONE OF PROXIMAL DEVELOPMENT (Vygotsky):
- What child can do with help (but not alone yet)
- Teacher provides just enough support (not too much, not too little)

EXAMPLE (Cutting with scissors):
1. Teacher cuts (child watches)
2. Teacher holds paper, child cuts (hand-over-hand if needed)
3. Child cuts, teacher provides verbal cues ("Open, close, open, close")
4. Child cuts independently

---

OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS (Promote thinking):

CLOSED (One answer): "What color is this?" (Red)
OPEN: "What do you notice about this?" (It's red, shiny, round...)

EXAMPLES:
- "What would happen if...?"
- "How did you make that?"
- "Why do you think...?"
- "Tell me about your drawing."

---

TRANSITIONS (Minimize waiting, behavior issues):

STRATEGIES:
- Songs/chants ("Clean up, clean up, everybody clean up...")
- Visual timers (show time remaining for center)
- Warnings ("5 more minutes, then we clean up")
- Engaging transitions ("Hop like a bunny to the carpet")
- Individual dismissal ("If you're wearing red, line up")

AVOID:
- Long wait times (sitting on carpet 10 min while others finish)
- Unstructured transitions (chaos, running)
```

---

## Behavior Guidance

```markdown
POSITIVE GUIDANCE:

PROACTIVE STRATEGIES:

CLEAR EXPECTATIONS:
- Teach rules (model, practice, reinforce)
- Positive language ("Walk" not "Don't run")
- Few rules (3-5 max):
  * Use kind words and hands
  * Listen when others are talking
  * Take care of our classroom
- Visual reminders (posters with pictures)

STRUCTURE & ROUTINE:
- Predictable schedule (reduces anxiety)
- Visual schedule (pictures for each activity)
- Warnings before transitions

ENGAGING CURRICULUM:
- Age-appropriate (not too easy/hard)
- Hands-on, active
- Boredom = behavior problems

---

IN-THE-MOMENT STRATEGIES:

REDIRECTION:
- Child misbehaves → redirect to appropriate activity
- "We don't throw blocks. Blocks are for building. Would you like to build a tower or play with the balls outside?"

NATURAL CONSEQUENCES:
- Child spills water → child cleans up
- Child breaks toy (accidentally) → toy goes away (can't play with it anymore)

LOGICAL CONSEQUENCES:
- Child throws sand → leaves sandbox (5 min, then can return)
- Child hits → sits out (2-3 min, not long timeout)

AVOID:
- Time-outs (long, isolating, not developmentally appropriate for young children)
- Shame ("You're being bad")
- Empty threats ("I'm calling your mom!")

---

CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS:

HITTING/BITING:
- Immediate: "Stop. Hitting hurts."
- Comfort victim first (attention to victim, not aggressor)
- Teach alternative: "Use words. Say 'I'm mad' or 'Stop, I don't like that'"
- If repeated: Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA, determine function: attention, escape, sensory)

TANTRUMS:
- Identify trigger (tired, hungry, frustrated, transition)
- Prevention: Snack before center time, warning before cleanup
- During: Stay calm, ensure safety, validate feelings ("You're upset because...")
- After: Teach coping skills (take deep breaths, ask for help)

REFUSAL:
- Offer choices ("Do you want to write with a pencil or marker?")
- Make it fun (sing cleanup song, race to see who finishes first)
- Non-negotiables: Clear and firm ("We all clean up. You can start with the blocks or the crayons.")

---

SOCIAL SKILLS TEACHING:

SHARING:
- Teach turn-taking (timer, "You can have it for 5 minutes, then Sarah's turn")
- Provide duplicates (multiple scoops at sand table)
- Model language ("Can I have a turn when you're done?")

PROBLEM-SOLVING:
- STEPS:
  1. Stop (calm down)
  2. Say the problem ("He took my toy")
  3. Think of solutions (ask for it back, trade, play together, play with something else)
  4. Try a solution
- Model, practice, reinforce

EMOTIONS:
- Label feelings ("You look frustrated")
- Books about emotions (Today I Feel Silly, The Way I Feel)
- Feelings chart (point to how you feel)
- Coping strategies (breathing, squeeze stress ball, hug stuffed animal)
```

## Family Engagement

```markdown
COMMUNICATION:

DAILY:
- Informal chats (pickup/drop-off)
- Communication app (Brightwheel, ClassDojo - photos, updates)
- Folder (send home notices, student work)

WEEKLY:
- Newsletter (highlights, upcoming events, at-home activities)

MONTHLY:
- Parent-teacher conferences (progress, goals, questions)

AS-NEEDED:
- Phone calls (concerns, celebrations)
- Email (documentation, detailed info)

---

FAMILY INVOLVEMENT:

IN-CLASS:
- Volunteer (help with centers, art projects)
- Read to class (share book, culture)
- Share expertise (parent is dentist → talk about dental health)

AT-HOME:
- Read daily (20 min)
- Practice skills (count objects, identify letters on signs)
- Limit screen time (<1 hour/day)
- Encourage play (outdoors, imaginative, with peers)

EVENTS:
- Open house (beginning of year, meet teacher, see classroom)
- Family nights (literacy night, math night, fun activities to do together)
- Celebrations (holiday parties, end-of-year picnic)
```

---

## Assessment

```markdown
ONGOING ASSESSMENT (Not tests!):

OBSERVATION:
- Anecdotal notes (jot observations during centers)
- Checklist (skills mastered: counts to 10, writes name, cuts on line)
- Photos/videos (document learning)

WORK SAMPLES:
- Portfolio (collect over time: drawings, writing samples, photos of projects)
- Shows growth (September vs May writing sample)

DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS:
- ASQ (Ages & Stages Questionnaire): General development
- DIBELS (reading readiness): Letter sounds, phonemic awareness
- GOLD (Teaching Strategies): Comprehensive (social, cognitive, physical, language)

REPORT CARDS:
- Standards-based (emerging, developing, proficient, advanced)
- NOT letter grades (A, B, C inappropriate for kindergarten)
- Focus on growth, effort (not just achievement)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Play is learning** - Not "wasting time" (builds cognitive, social, physical skills)
2. **Developmentally appropriate** - Expectations match age/stage (not push academics too early)
3. **Relationships matter** - Safe, nurturing environment → children thrive
4. **Positive guidance** - Teach skills (not punish behavior)
5. **Family partnership** - Parents = first teachers (collaborate, communicate)
