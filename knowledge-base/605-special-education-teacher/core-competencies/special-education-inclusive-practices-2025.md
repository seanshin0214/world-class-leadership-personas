## Special Education Law & Process

```markdown
IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act):

CORE PRINCIPLES:

1. FAPE (Free Appropriate Public Education):
   - Every child with disability entitled to education (at no cost to parents)
   - "Appropriate" = individualized, meets unique needs

2. LRE (Least Restrictive Environment):
   - Educate with non-disabled peers to maximum extent appropriate
   - Continuum of placements:
     * General education (full inclusion, with supports)
     * General ed with resource room (pull-out services)
     * Self-contained classroom (separate special ed class)
     * Separate school (specialized, for severe needs)
     * Home/hospital (if medically necessary)

3. IEP (Individualized Education Program):
   - Written plan (legally binding)
   - Annual goals, services, accommodations, modifications

4. PARENT PARTICIPATION:
   - Parents = equal members of IEP team
   - Prior written notice (inform of changes, decisions)
   - Consent required (evaluations, placement changes)

5. PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS:
   - Due process (parents can dispute decisions, hearings, mediations)

---

DISABILITY CATEGORIES (13 under IDEA):

1. AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD)
2. DEAF-BLINDNESS
3. DEAFNESS
4. EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE (ED)
5. HEARING IMPAIRMENT
6. INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY (ID, formerly "mental retardation")
7. MULTIPLE DISABILITIES
8. ORTHOPEDIC IMPAIRMENT
9. OTHER HEALTH IMPAIRMENT (OHI, includes ADHD)
10. SPECIFIC LEARNING DISABILITY (SLD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia)
11. SPEECH OR LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT
12. TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI)
13. VISUAL IMPAIRMENT

---

REFERRAL TO SERVICES PROCESS:

1. REFERRAL (Teacher, parent, doctor concern):
   - Student struggling academically, behaviorally, or developmentally

2. EVALUATION (60 days):
   - Comprehensive assessment (academic, cognitive, behavioral, adaptive, speech, OT/PT)
   - Parental consent required
   - Determine: Disability? + Adverse educational impact? = Eligibility

3. ELIGIBILITY MEETING:
   - Team reviews evaluation results
   - Eligible? → Develop IEP
   - Not eligible? → May qualify for 504 plan (accommodations only, no specialized instruction)

4. IEP DEVELOPMENT (Within 30 days of eligibility):
   - Team meeting (parents, teachers, specialists, administrator, student if appropriate)
   - Write IEP (goals, services, accommodations, placement)

5. IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Services begin (as written in IEP)

6. ANNUAL REVIEW:
   - Progress on goals, update IEP (every 12 months minimum)
   - Re-evaluation (every 3 years, or sooner if requested)

---

504 PLAN (Section 504 of Rehabilitation Act):

DIFFERENCE FROM IEP:
- 504: Accommodations only (level playing field, access)
- IEP: Specialized instruction + accommodations (teach differently)

ELIGIBILITY:
- Disability that substantially limits major life activity (learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, walking)
- Examples: ADHD, diabetes, asthma, anxiety, depression (if impacts school)

ACCOMMODATIONS (Examples):
- Extended time (tests, assignments)
- Preferential seating (front of class, near teacher)
- Frequent breaks
- Reduced homework
- Copy of notes
- Use of calculator, spell-check
- Separate, quiet testing location
```

## IEP Components

```markdown
IEP SECTIONS:

1. PRESENT LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE (PLOP/PLAAFP):
   - Current academic achievement, functional performance
   - Strengths, needs
   - Example: "Johnny reads at 2nd grade level (currently in 4th grade). He knows letter sounds but struggles with decoding multisyllabic words. Strength: Strong oral comprehension."

2. ANNUAL GOALS (Measurable):
   - SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
   - Example: "By May 2025, Johnny will decode 50 2-syllable words with 80% accuracy in 3 consecutive trials."

3. SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVES/BENCHMARKS (Optional, required for severe disabilities):
   - Steps toward annual goal
   - Example:
     * By Dec: Decode 20 2-syllable words with 70% accuracy
     * By Mar: Decode 35 2-syllable words with 75% accuracy
     * By May: Decode 50 2-syllable words with 80% accuracy

4. SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES:
   - What: Specialized instruction (reading intervention, math support, social skills)
   - How much: Frequency (2× per week), duration (30 min), location (resource room)
   - Provider: Special ed teacher, SLP, OT, PT

5. RELATED SERVICES:
   - Support to benefit from special education
   - Examples: Speech therapy, occupational therapy (OT), physical therapy (PT), counseling, transportation

6. SUPPLEMENTARY AIDS & SERVICES:
   - Supports in general education
   - Examples: Paraprofessional (aide), assistive technology (text-to-speech), modified materials

7. ACCOMMODATIONS:
   - Changes in HOW student learns, tested (not WHAT they learn)
   - Examples:
     * Presentation: Read aloud, large print, visual aids
     * Response: Oral answers, scribe, keyboard
     * Setting: Small group, separate room, reduce distractions
     * Timing/Scheduling: Extended time, frequent breaks

8. MODIFICATIONS (If needed):
   - Changes in WHAT student learns (different curriculum, lower expectations)
   - Examples: Reduced number of problems, simplified text, alternate grading
   - Caution: May affect diploma eligibility (some states)

9. PARTICIPATION IN STATE/DISTRICT ASSESSMENTS:
   - Standard test? (with or without accommodations)
   - Alternate assessment? (for significant cognitive disabilities, <1% of students)

10. PLACEMENT (LRE):
    - % time in general education
    - Justification if not 100% (why separate setting needed)

11. TRANSITION PLAN (Age 14-16+):
    - Postsecondary goals (college, employment, independent living)
    - Transition services (job training, life skills, community resources)
```

## Differentiation Strategies

```markdown
UNIVERSAL DESIGN FOR LEARNING (UDL):

3 PRINCIPLES:

1. MULTIPLE MEANS OF REPRESENTATION (How info presented):
   - Visual: Pictures, videos, graphic organizers
   - Auditory: Read aloud, audiobooks, verbal explanations
   - Tactile/Kinesthetic: Manipulatives, hands-on activities
   - Example: Teach fractions with visual (pie chart), manipulative (fraction tiles), real-life (pizza slices)

2. MULTIPLE MEANS OF ACTION & EXPRESSION (How students show learning):
   - Options: Written, oral, drawing, demonstration, project
   - Example: Book report → Write essay, OR create poster, OR give presentation, OR make video

3. MULTIPLE MEANS OF ENGAGEMENT (How to motivate):
   - Choice (topics, activities)
   - Relevance (connect to student interests, real life)
   - Collaboration (work with peers)
   - Example: Math word problems about student interests (sports stats, video games, cooking)

---

TIERED ASSIGNMENTS (Same topic, different complexity):

TIER 1 (Below grade level):
- Simplified text, fewer steps, more scaffolding, concrete examples

TIER 2 (On grade level):
- Standard assignment

TIER 3 (Above grade level):
- Extended, more complex, application, analysis

EXAMPLE (Essay on historical event):
- Tier 1: Fill-in-the-blank paragraph with sentence starters
- Tier 2: Write 3-paragraph essay with graphic organizer
- Tier 3: Write 5-paragraph essay, include multiple sources, analysis

---

SCAFFOLDING (Gradual release, "I do, We do, You do"):

1. I DO (Modeling):
   - Teacher demonstrates, thinks aloud
   - Example: "I'm going to solve this math problem. First, I read the problem..."

2. WE DO (Guided practice):
   - Class does together, teacher supports
   - Example: "Let's solve the next problem together. What should we do first?"

3. YOU DO TOGETHER (Partner/group):
   - Students practice with peers, teacher circulates
   - Example: "Work with your partner to solve these 3 problems."

4. YOU DO ALONE (Independent):
   - Student applies independently
   - Example: "Now try these 5 problems on your own."

---

ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY:

LOW-TECH:
- Pencil grips (improve handwriting)
- Graphic organizers (structure thoughts)
- Highlighters, color-coding (organize info)
- Timers (time management, ADHD)
- Fidgets (sensory, focus)

MID-TECH:
- Audio recorder (record lectures, playback)
- Calculators (math support)
- Spell-checker (writing support)

HIGH-TECH:
- Text-to-speech (Read&Write, Kurzweil, NaturalReader - reads text aloud)
- Speech-to-text (Dragon, Google Docs voice typing - dictate writing)
- Audiobooks (Bookshare, Learning Ally - accessible formats)
- Graphic organizer software (Inspiration, Kidspiration)
- Alternative keyboards (on-screen, large keys, one-handed)
- Communication devices (AAC, augmentative and alternative communication - for non-verbal students)
```

## Behavioral Support

```markdown
FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR ASSESSMENT (FBA):

PURPOSE:
- Understand WHY behavior occurs (function)
- Develop effective intervention (address function, not just punish)

FUNCTIONS OF BEHAVIOR (4):

1. ATTENTION (Get attention from adults, peers):
   - Example: Student calls out, disrupts class → teacher stops lesson, addresses student
   - Replacement: Teach to raise hand, get positive attention for appropriate behavior

2. ESCAPE/AVOIDANCE (Avoid task, situation):
   - Example: Student tears up worksheet (too hard, frustrated) → sent to office, escapes task
   - Replacement: Provide easier work, teach to ask for help, break task into smaller steps

3. TANGIBLE (Get object, activity):
   - Example: Student grabs toy from peer → gets toy
   - Replacement: Teach to ask ("Can I have a turn?"), share, wait

4. SENSORY (Feels good, internal stimulation):
   - Example: Student rocks in chair, hums → self-soothing, sensory input
   - Replacement: Provide alternative sensory input (fidget, chew toy, movement break)

---

FBA PROCESS:

1. DEFINE BEHAVIOR (Observable, measurable):
   - NOT: "Disrespectful"
   - YES: "Yells at teacher, refuses to follow directions, tears up papers" (specific)

2. COLLECT DATA (When, where, how often):
   - ABC Data (Antecedent → Behavior → Consequence):
     * Antecedent: What happened before (trigger)
     * Behavior: What student did
     * Consequence: What happened after (reinforced?)
   - Example:
     * A: Teacher gives math worksheet
     * B: Student tears up worksheet, throws on floor
     * C: Teacher sends to office (escapes math)
   - Pattern: Math tasks → disruptive behavior → escape (Function: Escape)

3. HYPOTHESIZE FUNCTION:
   - Based on data, what is student getting or avoiding?

4. DEVELOP BIP (Behavior Intervention Plan):
   - Prevent (change antecedent)
   - Teach (replacement behavior)
   - Respond (reinforce appropriate, don't reinforce inappropriate)

---

BEHAVIOR INTERVENTION PLAN (BIP):

COMPONENTS:

1. PREVENTION (Change environment, reduce triggers):
   - Example (Escape math):
     * Provide easier work (at student's level)
     * Break into smaller chunks (5 problems at a time, not 20)
     * Offer choice (which problems to do first)
     * Movement breaks (every 10 min)

2. TEACH REPLACEMENT BEHAVIOR (What TO do instead):
   - Functionally equivalent (meets same function)
   - Example (Escape math):
     * Teach: "I need help" (raise hand, ask appropriately)
     * Teach: "I need a break" (request break, use break card)
   - Practice, role-play, reinforce

3. REINFORCE APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR:
   - Positive reinforcement (praise, rewards, privileges)
   - Immediate, specific, consistent
   - Example: "Great job asking for help! Let's work on this together."

4. RESPOND TO INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR:
   - Don't reinforce function
   - Example (Escape math):
     * Don't send to office (that's escape, reinforces behavior)
     * Instead: Redirect, provide support, complete work (even if just 1 problem)
   - Calm, consistent, minimal attention

5. MONITOR & ADJUST:
   - Collect data (behavior decreasing?)
   - If not working after 2-4 weeks, revise plan

---

POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS & SUPPORTS (PBIS):

TIER 1 (Universal, all students, 80-90%):
- School-wide expectations (Be Respectful, Responsible, Safe)
- Teach, model, practice expectations
- Positive reinforcement (praise, tickets, rewards)
- Consistent consequences

TIER 2 (Targeted, at-risk students, 5-10%):
- Check-In/Check-Out (CICO): Daily check-ins, goal-setting, feedback
- Social skills groups (teach specific skills, small group)
- Mentoring (adult mentor, relationship building)

TIER 3 (Intensive, individual, 1-5%):
- FBA/BIP (individualized plan)
- Wraparound services (mental health, family support, outside agencies)
- High level of support (1:1 aide, counseling, specialized placement)
```

---

## Collaboration

```markdown
CO-TEACHING MODELS (Special ed + general ed together):

1. ONE TEACH, ONE ASSIST:
   - General ed teaches, special ed circulates (help individuals)
   - Least collaborative (not ideal long-term)

2. STATION TEACHING:
   - Divide class into 3 groups, rotate through stations
   - Both teachers lead station, one station independent
   - Benefits: Small group instruction, differentiation

3. PARALLEL TEACHING:
   - Divide class in half, both teach same content
   - Benefits: Lower student-teacher ratio, more participation

4. ALTERNATIVE TEACHING:
   - One teacher large group, other small group (pre-teach, re-teach, enrich)
   - Benefits: Targeted instruction

5. TEAM TEACHING:
   - Both teachers teach together (both lead, seamless)
   - Benefits: Expertise shared, modeling collaboration
   - Most collaborative (ideal)

---

COMMUNICATION WITH PARENTS:

REGULAR UPDATES:
- Weekly emails, phone calls (not just when problems)
- Communication log (daily notes home, behaviors, achievements)
- Positive first (strengths, successes, then concerns)

IEP MEETINGS:
- Before meeting: Send draft IEP (parents can review, prepare questions)
- During meeting:
  * Start positive (student strengths, progress)
  * Avoid jargon (explain terms, acronyms)
  * Listen (parents know child best, validate concerns)
  * Collaborate (parents = equal team members, not adversaries)
- After meeting: Provide copy of IEP, summarize decisions

DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS:
- Stay calm, professional (even if parent angry, defensive)
- Empathy: "I understand this is frustrating..."
- Focus on student (shared goal: student success)
- Document (notes from meetings, communications)

---

WORKING WITH RELATED SERVICES:

SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST (SLP):
- Collaborate: Share classroom vocabulary, upcoming topics (incorporate in therapy)
- Carryover: Practice speech goals in classroom (articulation, fluency, social language)

OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST (OT):
- Handwriting, fine motor (provide pencil grips, slant boards, adapted scissors in class)
- Sensory: Implement sensory strategies (movement breaks, fidgets, weighted lap pad)

PHYSICAL THERAPIST (PT):
- Positioning (adaptive seating, stander)
- Mobility (walker, wheelchair access)
- Gross motor (incorporate PT activities in PE, recess)

SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST:
- Assessments (cognitive, academic, behavioral evaluations)
- Counseling (individual, group for emotional, social issues)
- Consultation (behavior plans, mental health support)

PARAPROFESSIONAL (Aide):
- Training: Teach how to support student (not do for them, encourage independence)
- Communication: Daily check-ins, feedback, plans
- Respect: Professional, valued team member (not just "helper")
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **LRE first** - General education with supports (before separate placement)
2. **IEP is legal** - Implement as written (accommodations, services non-negotiable)
3. **Function-based** - Behavior = communication (understand function, teach replacement)
4. **Collaboration** - Team approach (teachers, parents, specialists, student)
5. **Presumed competence** - High expectations (all students can learn, with right supports)
