## Adult Learning Principles (Andragogy)

```markdown
MALCOLM KNOWLES' 6 PRINCIPLES:

1. NEED TO KNOW:
   - Adults want to know WHY they're learning something
   - "How will this help me in my job?"
   - Start with relevance, real-world application

2. SELF-CONCEPT:
   - Adults are self-directed
   - Don't talk down, treat as equals
   - Facilitate, don't lecture

3. PRIOR EXPERIENCE:
   - Adults bring experience (use it!)
   - Group discussions, peer learning
   - Acknowledge their expertise

4. READINESS:
   - Adults learn when they need to (just-in-time)
   - Tie to job performance, promotions
   - Solve real problems

5. ORIENTATION:
   - Task-centered, not subject-centered
   - "Here's how to handle difficult customers" (task)
   - vs "Communication theory" (subject)

6. MOTIVATION:
   - Intrinsic > extrinsic
   - Career advancement, personal satisfaction
   - Less motivated by grades, more by usefulness

---

LEARNING STYLES (Varied preferences):

VISUAL (65%):
- Prefer diagrams, charts, videos
- "Show me"
- Use: Slides, infographics, demos

AUDITORY (30%):
- Prefer lectures, discussions
- "Tell me"
- Use: Explanations, group discussions

KINESTHETIC (5%):
- Prefer hands-on practice
- "Let me try"
- Use: Simulations, role plays, activities

SOLUTION: Multi-modal approach (use all 3)
```

## Training Design

```markdown
70-20-10 LEARNING MODEL:

70% ON-THE-JOB:
- Assignments, projects, stretch goals
- Real work with coaching
- Most effective learning

20% SOCIAL:
- Mentoring, peer learning
- Coaching, feedback
- Communities of practice

10% FORMAL:
- Workshops, courses, eLearning
- Structured training
- Foundation only

→ Training is 10%, but often over-emphasized!

---

TRAINING NEEDS ANALYSIS:

ORGANIZATIONAL NEEDS:
- Business goals (increase sales 20%)
- Performance gaps (reps closing 30% vs target 50%)
- New initiatives (product launch, system change)

LEARNER NEEDS:
- Current skill level (beginner vs advanced)
- Job role (manager vs individual contributor)
- Learning preferences

GAP ANALYSIS:
Current state: 30% close rate
Desired state: 50% close rate
Gap: 20% (is training the solution?)

NOT TRAINING PROBLEMS:
- Lack of motivation (incentives issue)
- Poor tools (system issue)
- Unclear expectations (communication issue)
- Insufficient staff (resourcing issue)

→ Training solves SKILL gaps, not all problems

---

LEARNING OBJECTIVES (SMART):

BAD:
❌ "Understand customer service"

GOOD:
✅ "By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
    - Apply the 5-step customer service model to resolve complaints
    - De-escalate angry customers using 3 communication techniques
    - Document interactions in CRM system within 2 minutes"

(Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
```

## Workshop Facilitation

```markdown

---

BODY (80% of time):

- Builds engagement

SMALL GROUP DISCUSSIONS:
- 3-5 people per group
- Assign roles (facilitator, timekeeper, reporter)
- Debrief with full group

ROLE PLAYS:
- Practice scenarios
- Observer gives feedback
- Rotate roles

CASE STUDIES:

---

MANAGING DIFFICULT PARTICIPANTS:

THE DOMINATOR (talks too much):
- "Great point, let's hear from others"
- Use talking stick (physical object, only holder speaks)
- Private conversation during break

THE SILENT (won't participate):
- Call on them gently: "Alex, what are your thoughts?"
- Use small groups (less intimidating)
- Don't force, respect different styles

THE SKEPTIC (challenges everything):
- Acknowledge: "That's a valid concern"
- Ask group: "Has anyone dealt with this?"
- Offline conversation if persistent

THE DISTRACTED (phone, laptop):
- Ground rules upfront (no devices)
- Engaging activities (less opportunity to drift)
- Private conversation: "I noticed... everything ok?"

THE KNOW-IT-ALL:
- Leverage: "You have experience, can you share?"
- Redirect: "That's one approach, other ideas?"
- Don't argue, stay calm
```

## Virtual Training

```markdown
PLATFORM SETUP (Zoom, Teams):

BEFORE SESSION:
- Test tech (audio, video, screen share)
- Send pre-work (readings, video)
- Calendar invite with clear link

ENGAGEMENT CHALLENGES:
- Distractions (email, kids, pets)
- Zoom fatigue (passive watching)
- Technical issues

SOLUTIONS:

SHORTER SESSIONS:
- 60-90 min max (vs 3-4 hours in-person)
- More frequent (weekly vs quarterly)

FREQUENT INTERACTION:
- Poll every 10 min
- Chat questions
- Breakout rooms (small group discussions)

CAMERAS ON:
- Builds connection
- But respect bandwidth/privacy concerns

---

VIRTUAL FACILITATION TIPS:

TECH CHECK (5 min before):
- Audio, video working?
- Chat, polls enabled?
- Screen share tested?

ICEBREAKER (Virtual-friendly):
- "In chat, share one word to describe how you're feeling"
- "Change your Zoom background to your dream vacation"
- Quick, low-stakes

USE CHAT ACTIVELY:
- "Drop in chat: What's your biggest challenge?"
- Co-facilitator monitors chat, surfaces questions

BREAKOUT ROOMS:
- 3-5 people per room
- Clear instructions (written in chat)
- 5-10 min discussions
- Bring back, debrief

SLIDES:
- Less text (more visuals)
- Poll slides (interactive)
- Annotate tool (highlight, draw)

RECORD SESSION:
- For those who couldn't attend
- But reduces live engagement (know it's recorded)

---

PLATFORMS:

ZOOM:
- Breakout rooms, polls, whiteboard
- Recording
- 100+ participants

MS TEAMS:
- Integrated with Office 365
- Breakout rooms (now available)
- Good for enterprise

MIRO / MURAL:
- Virtual whiteboard
- Collaborative brainstorming
- Sticky notes, templates
```

## Evaluation (Kirkpatrick Model)

```markdown
LEVEL 1: REACTION (Satisfaction)
- Did they like it?
- "Smile sheets"
- Immediately after training

Example questions:
- "Rate the training 1-5 stars"
- "What did you like most?"
- "What would you improve?"

LIMITATION: Popular ≠ effective

---

LEVEL 2: LEARNING (Knowledge)
- Did they learn?
- Pre/post-test
- During or immediately after

Example:
- Pre-test: 60% average
- Post-test: 85% average
- 25% improvement ✓

LIMITATION: Knowledge ≠ behavior change

---

LEVEL 3: BEHAVIOR (Application)
- Do they use it on the job?
- 30-90 days after training
- Observation, surveys, manager feedback

Example:
- Manager observes: "80% of reps now use the customer service model"
- Self-report: "I use the techniques daily"

CHALLENGES:
- Time lag
- Other factors (system changes, new manager)

---

LEVEL 4: RESULTS (Business Impact)
- Did it achieve business goals?
- 6-12 months after
- KPIs, ROI

Example:
- Goal: Increase sales 20%
- Result: Sales increased 25%
- ROI: Training cost $50K, revenue increase $500K → 10:1 ROI

CHALLENGES:
- Hard to isolate training impact (many factors)
- Long timeframe

---

ROI CALCULATION:

ROI = (Benefits - Costs) / Costs × 100%

COSTS:
- Trainer salary/fees
- Materials (slides, handouts)
- Participant time (30 people × 4 hours × $50/hr = $6K)
- Venue, food
Total: $10K

BENEFITS:
- Sales increase: $100K
- Cost savings: $20K
Total: $120K

ROI = ($120K - $10K) / $10K × 100% = 1100%

→ For every $1 spent, $11 return
```

## Instructional Design for Training

```markdown
SAM (Successive Approximation Model):

PREPARATION:
- Gather info (needs, audience, constraints)
- Brainstorm ideas

ITERATIVE DESIGN:
- Prototype (rough draft)
- Review with stakeholders
- Revise
- Repeat (3-5 cycles)

FINAL DEVELOPMENT:
- Build full course
- Pilot test
- Launch

ADVANTAGES:
- Faster than ADDIE
- Iterative (early feedback)
- Collaborative

---

MICROLEARNING:

DEFINITION: Bite-sized content (3-7 min)

FORMATS:
- Video (2-min explainer)
- Infographic (1-pager)
- Quiz (5 questions)
- Job aid (checklist, template)

BENEFITS:
- Fits busy schedules
- Mobile-friendly
- Just-in-time (access when needed)

EXAMPLE:
Instead of 3-hour workshop on "Email Etiquette":
- Video 1: Writing subject lines (3 min)
- Video 2: Professional tone (4 min)
- Checklist: Email do's & don'ts (1-pager)

---

GAMIFICATION:

ELEMENTS:
- Points (earn for completing modules)
- Badges (achievements)
- Leaderboards (competition)
- Levels (beginner → expert)

EXAMPLES:
- Sales training: "Close 10 deals" (badge)
- Compliance training: Quiz (points per correct answer)
- Onboarding: "Complete all 5 modules" (level up)

CAUTION:
- Don't over-gamify (distraction)
- Focus on learning, not just points
```
