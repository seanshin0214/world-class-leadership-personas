## Course Design

```markdown
BACKWARD DESIGN (Start with outcomes, work backward):

1. LEARNING OUTCOMES (What students will know/do):
   - Specific, measurable, achievable
   - Use Bloom's Taxonomy (levels of cognitive complexity):
     * Remembering: Define, list, recall
     * Understanding: Explain, summarize, classify
     * Applying: Use, solve, demonstrate
     * Analyzing: Compare, contrast, differentiate
     * Evaluating: Critique, judge, justify
     * Creating: Design, construct, develop
   
   EXAMPLE (Statistics course):
   - "Students will be able to calculate and interpret a 95% confidence interval" (Applying)
   - "Students will be able to critique the methodology of a published research study" (Evaluating)

2. ASSESSMENTS (How to measure outcomes):
   - Align with outcomes (if outcome is "analyze," assessment should require analysis, not just recall)
   - Formative: Low-stakes, feedback (quizzes, homework, drafts)
   - Summative: High-stakes, grade (exams, final papers, projects)
   
   EXAMPLE:
   - Outcome: "Critique methodology"
   - Assessment: Written critique of a journal article (rubric: research question, methods, validity, interpretation)

3. LEARNING ACTIVITIES (How students will learn):
   - Active > Passive (students DO, not just listen)
   - Scaffolding (build complexity gradually)
   
   EXAMPLE:
   - Lecture: Explain confidence intervals (concept, formula)
   - Practice: Calculate CI with sample data (guided)
   - Application: Analyze real dataset, interpret CI (independent)

---

SYLLABUS DESIGN:

REQUIRED COMPONENTS:

COURSE INFORMATION:
- Title, number, section, semester
- Meeting time, location
- Instructor: Name, office hours, email, response time (e.g., "within 24 hours")

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
- 3-5 major outcomes (clear, measurable)

REQUIRED MATERIALS:
- Textbook (edition, ISBN), articles, software
- Cost considerations (library reserves, open educational resources - OER)

GRADING:
- Breakdown: Exams 40%, papers 30%, participation 20%, homework 10%
- Scale: A (90-100%), B (80-89%), etc.
- Late policy: -10% per day, or no late work accepted

SCHEDULE:
- Weekly topics, readings (due before class)
- Assignment deadlines
- Flexibility statement: "Schedule may change; updates announced in class/email"

POLICIES:
- Attendance (required? excused absences?)
- Academic integrity (plagiarism = F, university honor code)
- Accommodations: "Students with disabilities contact Disability Services; I will provide accommodations as needed"
- Preferred pronouns, inclusive language

TONE:
- Welcoming, but clear expectations
- "I'm excited to explore this topic with you, and I expect active engagement from all students."

---

ACTIVE LEARNING STRATEGIES:

THINK-PAIR-SHARE:
1. Pose question (e.g., "What factors might explain this trend?")
2. Think (1-2 min, individual reflection)
3. Pair (discuss with neighbor, 3-5 min)
4. Share (volunteers share with class, instructor synthesizes)
- Benefits: All students process, low-stakes, participation

CASE STUDIES:
- Real-world scenarios (apply concepts, problem-solve)
- Example (Business course): "Company X is losing market share. Analyze and recommend strategy."
- Discussion: Small groups, present findings

FLIPPED CLASSROOM:
- Pre-class: Watch lecture video, read (asynchronous)
- In-class: Active work (discussions, problem-solving, projects)
- Benefits: Use class time for high-value activities (not passive lecture)

JIGSAW:
1. Divide topic into parts (A, B, C, D)
2. Expert groups: All A's together, become experts on A (same for B, C, D)
3. Teaching groups: One A, B, C, D per group; teach each other
- Benefits: Peer teaching, everyone contributes

MINUTE PAPER:
- End of class: "What's the most important thing you learned today? What's still unclear?"
- Collect (anonymous or named), read, address confusion next class
- Benefits: Formative assessment, quick feedback

---

INCLUSIVE TEACHING:

UNIVERSAL DESIGN FOR LEARNING (UDL):
- Multiple means of representation (visual, auditory, text)
- Multiple means of engagement (choice, relevance, collaboration)
- Multiple means of expression (written, oral, creative)

EXAMPLE (Presentation assignment):
- Traditional: "Give a 10-minute talk"
- UDL: "Present your findings via 10-minute talk, OR 5-page paper, OR video, OR poster"

ACCESSIBILITY:
- Slides: Large font (24+ pt), high contrast, alt text for images
- Videos: Captions (auto-generate, edit for accuracy)
- Handouts: Screen-reader compatible (PDFs with text, not images of text)
- Assignments: Flexible deadlines for documented needs

REPRESENTATION:
- Diverse examples, authors (not all Western, male, white)
- Inclusive language ("they" for singular, "folks" instead of "guys")
- Acknowledge different backgrounds, experiences (students bring valuable perspectives)

GROWTH MINDSET:
- Emphasize: Ability is not fixed (intelligence, skill can be developed)
- Praise effort, strategies (not innate ability)
- "You worked hard on that analysis" > "You're smart"
- Mistakes = learning opportunities (normalize struggle)
```

## Teaching Methods

```markdown
LECTURING (Effectively):

PROBLEMS WITH TRADITIONAL LECTURE:
- Passive (students don't retain much, attention wanes after 10-15 min)
- No feedback (instructor doesn't know if students understand)

IMPROVEMENTS:

INTERACTIVE LECTURE:
- Pause every 10-15 min (ask question, think-pair-share, quick activity)
- Example: "Turn to your neighbor and explain why this matters"

STORYTELLING:
- Narratives (engage emotions, memorable)
- Example (History): Don't just list dates; tell story of person who lived through event

MULTIMEDIA:
- Videos (2-5 min, break monotony, visual learners)
- Demos (live experiments, simulations)
- Avoid: Death by PowerPoint (text-heavy slides, read verbatim)

CLEAR STRUCTURE:
- Roadmap: "Today we'll cover A, B, C" (orientation)
- Signposting: "Now moving to B..." (transitions)
- Summary: "To recap, key points are..." (consolidation)

---

DISCUSSION FACILITATION:

PREPARING STUDENTS:
- Pre-reading (discussion questions in advance, students prepare)
- Grading participation (rubric: frequency, quality, respectfulness)

TECHNIQUES:

WAIT TIME:
- After asking question, wait 5-10 seconds (uncomfortable silence, but students need time to think)
- Don't call on first hand immediately

COLD CALLING (With care):
- "Sam, what do you think?" (puts students on spot, can be stressful)
- Mitigate: Warn ("I'll be calling on people today, so be ready"), allow pass, supportive tone

FISHBOWL:
- Inner circle discusses, outer circle observes
- Switch roles
- Benefits: Focused discussion, observation skills

SOCRATIC METHOD:
- Question-driven (no lecturing, only asking questions)
- Example:
  * "What's the main argument?"
  * "What evidence supports it?"
  * "What are the weaknesses?"
  * "How might the author respond?"
- Benefits: Critical thinking, but can be intimidating

MANAGING DOMINATORS:
- "Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet"
- Private conversation: "I appreciate your enthusiasm, but please leave space for others"

ENCOURAGING QUIET STUDENTS:
- Small groups first (less intimidating), then share with class
- Written responses (on board, chat, not just oral)
- One-on-one: "I'd love to hear your thoughts; what would make you more comfortable contributing?"

ASSESSMENT & GRADING:

RUBRICS (Clear criteria):

EXAMPLE (Essay rubric, 100 points):

| Criterion | Excellent (90-100) | Good (80-89) | Satisfactory (70-79) | Needs Improvement (<70) |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Thesis (20 pts) | Clear, specific, arguable | Clear but broad | Vague or not arguable | Missing or unclear |
| Evidence (30 pts) | Strong, relevant, well-integrated | Adequate, relevant | Some evidence, weak integration | Little or irrelevant |
| Analysis (30 pts) | Deep, insightful, original | Good analysis, some depth | Surface-level | Little to no analysis |
| Organization (10 pts) | Logical, coherent, smooth transitions | Mostly clear | Some disorganization | Confusing structure |
| Writing (10 pts) | Clear, error-free | Minor errors, clear | Multiple errors, understandable | Serious errors, unclear |

FEEDBACK:
- Specific (not just "good job" or "needs work")
- Actionable ("Strengthen your thesis by specifying X" > "Weak thesis")
- Timely (within 1-2 weeks, while fresh)
- Balance: Strengths + areas for improvement

GRADE INFLATION (Avoid):
- Maintain standards (A = excellent, not just "completed assignment")
- Norm-referencing (if everyone gets A, either test too easy or grade inflation)
- Criterion-referencing (better): Grade against standard, not curve

---

ONLINE/HYBRID TEACHING:

LMS (Learning Management System):
- Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle (organize materials, assignments, grades)

BEST PRACTICES:

PRESENCE:
- Videos (face-to-camera intros, short lecture snippets, announcements)
- Regular communication (weekly announcements, prompt email responses)
- Office hours (Zoom, encourage students to drop in)

ENGAGEMENT:
- Discussion boards (asynchronous, everyone can contribute)
  * Prompt: "Post initial response by Wednesday, reply to 2 peers by Friday"
- Breakout rooms (Zoom, small group discussions)
- Polls, quizzes (check understanding, interactive)

ORGANIZATION:
- Consistent structure (same layout each week, easy to navigate)
- Clear expectations (deadlines, instructions, grading criteria)

CHALLENGES:
- Zoom fatigue (shorter sessions, breaks, async alternatives)
- Inequity (internet access, home environment, flexible deadlines/options)

INTRODUCTION:
- Hook (why topic matters)
- Context (background, previous research)
- Gap (what's missing, why your study needed)
- Research question/hypothesis
- Contribution ("This study contributes by...")

LITERATURE REVIEW:
- Synthesize (not just summarize each article, organize by theme)
- Critical (evaluate strengths, weaknesses, gaps)
- Lead to your question (show how your work fits)

- Tables, figures (visualize data, clear labels)
- Statistical significance (p-values, confidence intervals)

DISCUSSION:
- Interpret (what do results mean?)
- Connect to literature (support or contradict previous findings?)
- Limitations (acknowledge weaknesses, generalizability)
- Implications (so what? practical applications, future research)

STYLE:
- Clarity > complexity (avoid jargon, explain technical terms)

## Mentorship & Advising

```markdown
UNDERGRADUATE ADVISING:

ACADEMIC PLANNING:
- Degree requirements (major, minor, gen eds, credit hours)
- Course sequencing (prerequisites, availability)
- Registration (help navigate system, overrides if needed)

CAREER GUIDANCE:
- Explore options (grad school, industry, teaching, research)
- Skills development (internships, research, study abroad)
- Letters of recommendation (give ample notice, 2-4 weeks, provide CV/statement)

PERSONAL SUPPORT:
- Listen (students face stress, mental health issues, life challenges)
- Refer (counseling center, academic support, financial aid)
- Boundaries (be supportive, but not therapist; know limits)

---

GRADUATE ADVISING:

RESEARCH MENTORSHIP:
- Regular meetings (weekly or biweekly, discuss progress, challenges)
- Set expectations (clear milestones, timelines, authorship agreements)
- Balance: Guidance vs independence (scaffolding, gradually release)

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT:
- Conferences (present, network, travel grants)
- Teaching experience (TA, guest lectures, develop own course)
- Publications (co-author, sole author, help navigate process)
- Job market prep (CV, cover letter, practice talks, mock interviews)

FEEDBACK:
- Constructive (specific, actionable, balanced)
- Timely (on drafts, within 1-2 weeks)
- Encouraging (acknowledge effort, celebrate progress)

DIVERSITY & INCLUSION:
- Be aware of biases (implicit, structural barriers)
- Advocate (for underrepresented students, equitable opportunities)
- Mentorship for all (not just students who remind you of yourself)

---

DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS:

UNDERPERFORMANCE:
- Private, respectful
- Specific examples ("You missed 5 out of 10 deadlines")
- Collaborative problem-solving ("What's getting in the way? How can I support you?")
- Clear consequences ("If X doesn't improve, then Y")

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:
- Meet with student, hear their side
- Explain policy, consequences (F on assignment, F in course, honor code violation)
- Document (keep records, emails, evidence)
- Report (if required by institution)

MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS:
- Express concern ("I've noticed you seem stressed; are you okay?")
- Listen, validate (don't diagnose or treat)
- Refer to counseling center ("I think talking to a counselor might help; here's the contact")
- Follow up (check in later, "How are things going?")
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Student-centered design** - Start with learning outcomes (what students will learn, not what you'll teach)
2. **Active learning** - Students learn by doing (not just listening)
3. **Clear expectations** - Syllabus, rubrics, feedback (reduce ambiguity, increase fairness)
4. **Research informs teaching** - Stay current in field, bring scholarship to classroom
5. **Mentorship matters** - Support whole student (academic, professional, personal growth)
