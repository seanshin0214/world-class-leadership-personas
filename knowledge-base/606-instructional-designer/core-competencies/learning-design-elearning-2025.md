## ADDIE Model

```
ANALYZE → DESIGN → DEVELOP → IMPLEMENT → EVALUATE

ANALYZE (What's needed?):
- Learner analysis (who, prior knowledge, learning style)
- Context (where, when, constraints)
- Learning needs (gap between current & desired performance)

DESIGN (How to teach?):
- Learning objectives (measurable outcomes)
- Assessment strategy (how to measure success)
- Instructional strategy (lecture, activity, simulation)
- Content outline

DEVELOP (Create materials):
- Storyboards
- Content creation (videos, slides, activities)
- Prototype & test

IMPLEMENT (Deliver):
- Pilot with small group
- Full rollout
- Instructor training (if applicable)

EVALUATE (Did it work?):
- Learner feedback (surveys, ratings)
- Assessment results (quiz scores, project quality)
- Business impact (performance improvement)
- Iterate based on data
```

## Learning Objectives (Bloom's Taxonomy)

```markdown
SMART OBJECTIVES:
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound

FORMAT:
"By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to [verb] [object] [condition]"

BLOOM'S TAXONOMY (Cognitive Domain):

REMEMBER (Lowest):
Verbs: Define, list, recall, recognize, state
Example: "List the 5 steps of the ADDIE model"

UNDERSTAND:
Verbs: Describe, explain, summarize, paraphrase
Example: "Explain the difference between formative and summative assessment"

APPLY:
Verbs: Demonstrate, use, solve, apply
Example: "Apply the ADDIE model to design a training module"

ANALYZE:
Verbs: Compare, contrast, categorize, examine
Example: "Analyze a case study to identify learning needs"

EVALUATE:
Verbs: Assess, critique, justify, defend
Example: "Evaluate the effectiveness of an eLearning course"

CREATE (Highest):
Verbs: Design, develop, construct, produce
Example: "Design an interactive eLearning module on customer service"

---

EXAMPLES (Bad → Good):

BAD:
❌ "Understand project management"
(Not measurable, vague verb)

GOOD:
✅ "Create a project plan using Microsoft Project"
(Action verb, specific, measurable)

BAD:
❌ "Learn about cybersecurity"
(Not measurable)

GOOD:
✅ "Identify 3 common phishing techniques and explain how to prevent them"
(Measurable: can check if they identified 3 + explained prevention)
```

## Instructional Strategies

```markdown
TELL → SHOW → DO → CHECK

1. TELL (Direct Instruction):
   - Lecture, reading, video
   - Efficient for facts, concepts
   - Best for: Declarative knowledge ("What is X?")
   - Limit: 10-15 minutes (attention span)

2. SHOW (Demonstration):
   - Model the skill
   - Step-by-step walkthrough
   - Screen recording, live demo
   - Best for: Procedural knowledge ("How to X")

3. DO (Practice):
   - Hands-on activity
   - Simulation, scenario, case study
   - Best for: Application
   - Provide feedback immediately

4. CHECK (Assessment):
   - Quiz, project, observation
   - Formative: During learning (check understanding)
   - Summative: End of learning (measure achievement)

---

PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING (PBL):

Structure:
1. Present realistic problem (e.g., "Customer complaints increased 20%")
2. Learners research & analyze
3. Develop solution
4. Present to peers
5. Instructor provides feedback

Benefits:
- Active learning (not passive listening)
- Critical thinking
- Motivation (real-world relevance)

Example:
Problem: "Your company's customer satisfaction score dropped from 85% to 70%. 
         Analyze data, identify root causes, and propose solutions."

---

SCAFFOLDING:

Gradually reduce support as learner gains competence

LEVEL 1 (Beginner): Full guidance
- Step-by-step instructions
- Examples provided
- Low complexity

LEVEL 2 (Intermediate): Partial guidance
- Hints, not full instructions
- Some examples, some discovery
- Medium complexity

LEVEL 3 (Advanced): Minimal guidance
- Authentic problem
- Self-directed
- High complexity

Example (Excel training):
- L1: "Click cell A1, type =SUM(, select B1:B10, press Enter"
- L2: "Calculate the total of column B using the SUM function"
- L3: "Analyze this sales data and create a summary report"
```

## eLearning Design

### Multimedia Principles (Mayer)

```markdown
1. MULTIMEDIA PRINCIPLE:
People learn better from words + pictures than words alone
✅ Diagram with labels
❌ Text-only explanation

2. CONTIGUITY PRINCIPLE:
Place text next to corresponding graphics
✅ Labels directly on diagram
❌ Legend far from diagram

3. MODALITY PRINCIPLE:
Use narration + graphics (not text + graphics)
✅ Voiceover explaining diagram
❌ Text blocks with diagram (split attention)

4. REDUNDANCY PRINCIPLE:
Don't use narration + on-screen text + graphics simultaneously
✅ Narration + graphics
❌ Narration + identical text + graphics (cognitive overload)

5. COHERENCE PRINCIPLE:
Exclude extraneous material (decorative images, background music)
✅ Simple, focused slide
❌ Cluttered slide with stock photos

6. PERSONALIZATION PRINCIPLE:
Use conversational style ("You can...") not formal ("One can...")
✅ "In this lesson, you'll learn..."
❌ "In this lesson, learners will..."

7. VOICE PRINCIPLE:
Use human voice, not machine voice
✅ Professional narrator
❌ Text-to-speech robot voice

8. SEGMENTING PRINCIPLE:
Break content into learner-paced segments
✅ 3-minute micro-lessons with pauses
❌ 30-minute uninterrupted video
```

### Slide Design

```markdown
BEFORE (Bad):

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PROJECT MANAGEMENT FUNDAMENTALS         │
│                                         │
│ Project management is the application   │
│ of knowledge, skills, tools, and        │
│ techniques to project activities to     │
│ meet the project requirements. It       │
│ involves five process groups: Initiate, │
│ Plan, Execute, Monitor & Control, Close.│
│                                         │
│ Key skills: Leadership, communication,  │
│ time management, risk management,       │
│ stakeholder management, budgeting.      │
│                                         │
│ [Small stock photo of meeting]          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Problems:

- Avoid red-green (colorblind-friendly)

LAYOUT:
- 1 idea per slide
- Plenty of white space
- Align elements to grid
- Consistent placement (title always top-left, etc.)

IMAGES:
- High-resolution (not pixelated)
- Relevant (not decorative)
- Simple (not cluttered)
```

C) 500-page user manual
D) Weekly webinars

Feedback:
B is best because:
- Self-paced accommodates varying skill levels
- Hands-on practice builds confidence
- Videos are engaging (not dry reading)

---

DRAG-AND-DROP:

Task: "Match each ADDIE phase to its description"

[Analyze] [Design] [Develop] [Implement] [Evaluate]

Drop zones:
□ Create materials → [Develop] ✅
□ Identify learning needs → [Analyze] ✅
□ Deliver course → [Implement] ✅
□ Write objectives → [Design] ✅
□ Measure effectiveness → [Evaluate] ✅

---

BRANCHING SCENARIO:

You're a manager. An employee made a mistake. What do you do?

A) Yell at employee → Outcome: Employee quits, morale drops ❌
B) Ignore it → Outcome: Mistake repeats, becomes pattern ❌
C) Discuss privately, focus on learning → Outcome: Employee improves ✅

(Learners see consequences of choices)

---

SIMULATION:

Virtual environment to practice skills safely

Examples:
- Flight simulator (pilots)
- Virtual patient (medical training)
- Business simulation (decision-making)
- Coding sandbox (programming practice)
```

---

## Assessment

```markdown
FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT (During learning):
- Knowledge checks every 3-5 slides
- Practice activities
- Discussion questions
- Self-assessment quizzes

Purpose: Check understanding, provide feedback
Not graded (low stakes)

---

SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT (End of learning):
- Final quiz/exam
- Project
- Presentation
- Performance evaluation

Purpose: Measure achievement of objectives
Graded (high stakes)

---

QUIZ BEST PRACTICES:

MULTIPLE CHOICE:
✅ One correct answer, 3-4 plausible distractors
✅ Avoid "All of the above" / "None of the above"
✅ Randomize answer order
❌ Trick questions (not measuring learning)

TRUE/FALSE:
⚠️ 50% chance of guessing correctly
✅ Use sparingly
✅ Include explanation for why true/false

FILL-IN-THE-BLANK:
✅ Tests recall (not just recognition)
✅ Good for key terms, formulas
❌ Hard to auto-grade (spelling variations)

ESSAY/SHORT ANSWER:
✅ Tests higher-order thinking (analyze, evaluate)
✅ Allows for nuanced understanding
❌ Time-consuming to grade
❌ Not scalable for large courses

---
