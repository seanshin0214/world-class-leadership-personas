## Course Design

```markdown
BACKWARD DESIGN (Wiggins & McTighe):

STAGE 1: Desired Results
- What should students learn?
- Learning outcomes (measurable, specific)
- Example: "Students will be able to analyze primary sources using historical methods"

STAGE 2: Assessment Evidence
- How will you know they learned?
- Formative (quizzes, discussions)
- Summative (exams, papers, projects)

STAGE 3: Learning Activities
- What will students do to learn?
- Lectures, readings, discussions, labs
- Active learning (not just passive listening)

---

LEARNING OUTCOMES:

BLOOM'S TAXONOMY (revised):

REMEMBER (lowest):
- Define, list, identify
- "List the 5 stages of mitosis"

UNDERSTAND:
- Explain, summarize, paraphrase
- "Explain the process of photosynthesis"

APPLY:
- Use, implement, demonstrate
- "Calculate the standard deviation of this dataset"

ANALYZE:
- Compare, contrast, differentiate
- "Compare Keynesian and Classical economic theories"

EVALUATE:
- Critique, judge, assess
- "Evaluate the effectiveness of this research design"

CREATE (highest):
- Design, construct, develop
- "Design an experiment to test this hypothesis"

WRITE AS:
"By the end of this course, students will be able to [verb] [object] [criterion]"
Example: "Students will be able to critique (verb) empirical research articles (object) using methodological standards (criterion)"

---

SYLLABUS:

ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS:

COURSE INFORMATION:
- Title, number, credits
- Meeting times, location
- Instructor contact (office hours, email, response time)

COURSE DESCRIPTION:
- Overview (what is this course about?)
- Prerequisites

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
- 4-6 outcomes (specific, measurable)

REQUIRED MATERIALS:
- Textbook (ISBN, where to purchase)
- Readings (articles, book chapters)
- Technology (LMS, software)

GRADING:
- Breakdown (exams 40%, papers 30%, participation 10%, quizzes 20%)
- Scale (A 90-100%, B 80-89%, etc.)
- Late policy ("10% off per day, max 3 days late")

SCHEDULE:
- Week-by-week topics, readings, assignments

POLICIES:
- Attendance ("2 absences allowed, then grade penalty")
- Academic honesty (plagiarism = F, report to dean)
- Accommodations (students with disabilities contact disability services)
- Title IX (sexual harassment reporting)

---

ACTIVE LEARNING:

WHY?
- Lectures alone: 5% retention
- Discussion: 50% retention
- Practice: 75% retention
- Teach others: 90% retention

STRATEGIES:

THINK-PAIR-SHARE:
1. Think (1-2 min, individual reflection)
2. Pair (2-3 min, discuss with neighbor)
3. Share (class discussion, call on pairs)

MINUTE PAPER:
- Last 5 min of class
- "What was the most important thing you learned today?"
- "What question remains unanswered?"
- Collect, read (formative assessment)

JIGSAW:
- Divide topic into parts
- Each group becomes "expert" on one part
- Regroup (one expert from each group)
- Teach each other

CASE STUDIES:
- Real-world scenario
- Analyze, apply concepts
- Example (business): "Company X is losing market share. What should they do?"

FLIPPED CLASSROOM:
- Pre-class: Watch lecture video, read (at home)
- In-class: Discussion, problem-solving, application
- Maximizes active learning time

PEER INSTRUCTION:
- Pose question (conceptual, not memorization)
- Students vote (clickers, hand raise)
- If <70% correct: Discuss with neighbors, revote
- If >70%: Move on

## Teaching Techniques

```markdown
LECTURING:

STRUCTURE:
- Introduction (5 min):
  * Hook (question, story, current event)
  * Preview (today we'll cover...)
- Body (35 min):
  * 3-5 main points
  * Examples, analogies
  * Change activity every 10-15 min (attention span)
- Conclusion (5 min):
  * Summary (key takeaways)
  * Preview next class

DELIVERY:
- Eye contact (scan room, don't fixate on notes)
- Voice (vary pitch, volume, pace - avoid monotone)
- Movement (walk, don't stand behind podium entire time)
- Gestures (natural, not distracting)
- Pause (after key points, let sink in)

SLIDES:
- Minimal text (6 words per bullet, 6 bullets max)
- Visuals (images, graphs, not walls of text)
- Font size 24+ (readable from back)
- High contrast (dark text, light background or vice versa)
- Avoid animations (distracting)

---

FACILITATING DISCUSSION:

COLD CALLING:
- Pick students randomly (not just volunteers)
- Give think time (5-10 seconds after asking question)
- "I'll come back to you" (if student doesn't know, don't embarrass)

WAIT TIME:
- Ask question, wait 5-10 seconds (resist urge to answer own question)
- Students need time to think

REDIRECT:
- Student answers → ask another student to respond
- "Do you agree? Why or why not?"
- Builds on each other's ideas

SOCRATIC METHOD:
- Ask probing questions (not give answers)
- "What do you think?" → "Why?" → "What's the evidence?"
- Guide students to discover concepts themselves

MANAGING DOMINANT STUDENTS:
- "Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet"
- Call on others before they raise hand
- Private conversation (appreciate participation, but give others chance)

ENCOURAGING QUIET STUDENTS:
- Think-pair-share (less intimidating)
- Small group discussions
- Online discussion boards (some prefer writing)
- Don't force (some learn by listening)

---

OFFICE HOURS:

PURPOSE:
- Answer questions
- Provide feedback on assignments
- Build rapport
- Advising (career, grad school)

STRATEGIES:
- Hold in office + coffee shop (some students intimidated by office)
- Online option (Zoom, for remote students)
- Advertise (remind students, not just in syllabus)
- Group sessions (exam review, common questions)

COMMON QUESTIONS:
- "How can I improve my grade?"
  * Review exams, papers (specific feedback)
  * Suggest study strategies
- "Can I turn this in late?"
  * Refer to syllabus policy
  * Be consistent (fairness)
- "I don't understand X"
  * Ask them to explain what they do understand (find gap)
  * Provide examples, analogies
```

## Assessment

```markdown
FORMATIVE (Ongoing, low-stakes):

PURPOSE:
- Check understanding (are students learning?)
- Adjust teaching (if many struggling, re-teach)
- Low/no points (focus on learning, not grade)

EXAMPLES:
- Clicker questions (during lecture)
- Minute papers (end of class)
- Quizzes (online, multiple attempts)
- Discussion board posts
- Draft papers (feedback before final)

---

SUMMATIVE (Final, high-stakes):

EXAMS:

MULTIPLE CHOICE:
- Pros: Easy to grade, objective
- Cons: Mostly tests recall (not higher-order thinking)
- Tips: 
  * 4 answer choices (A-D)
  * Avoid "all of the above," "none of the above" (confusing)
  * Distractors plausible (not obviously wrong)

SHORT ANSWER:
- Pros: Tests understanding, not just recognition
- Cons: More time to grade

ESSAY:
- Pros: Tests synthesis, critical thinking
- Cons: Time-consuming to grade, subjective
- Tips: Provide rubric (criteria, point values)

---

PAPERS:

TYPES:
- Research paper (original research or literature review)
- Reflection paper (personal insights, connections)
- Analytical paper (analyze text, data, argument)

RUBRIC:
- Thesis/Argument (25%): Clear, specific, debatable
- Evidence (25%): Relevant, sufficient, credible sources
- Organization (20%): Logical flow, transitions
- Writing (20%): Grammar, clarity, style
- Citations (10%): Proper format (APA, MLA, Chicago)

PREVENT PLAGIARISM:
- Teach citation (students often don't know how)
- Turnitin (plagiarism detection)
- Scaffolding (proposal → annotated bibliography → draft → final)
  * Harder to plagiarize if tracking process
- Unique prompts (not generic "write about X" - harder to find online)

---

PROJECTS:

GROUP PROJECTS:
- Peer evaluation (rate each member's contribution)
- Individual components (everyone accountable)
- Roles (leader, researcher, writer, presenter)

PRESENTATIONS:
- Rubric: Content (40%), Delivery (30%), Visuals (20%), Q&A (10%)
- Record (students nervous, can review later)
- Peer feedback (audience evaluates)

---

GRADING:

EFFICIENCY:
- Rubrics (faster, consistent)
- Comment banks (common feedback, copy-paste)
- Grade in batches (all question 1, then all question 2 - consistency)
- Return promptly (within 1-2 weeks - students need feedback to improve)

GRADE INFLATION:
- National average GPA: 3.1 (up from 2.5 in 1960s)
- Pressure: Student evaluations, tenure review (low grades = bad evals)
- Maintain standards (rigor matters, degree value)

FINAL GRADES:
- Weighted average (based on syllabus)
- Curve (optional, if exam too hard)
  * Add points to all (shift up)
  * Percentile (top 10% = A, next 20% = B, etc.)
- Borderline cases (89.5% → round up to A? Syllabus policy)
```

   - Qualitative (words, themes): Interviews, observations
   - Mixed methods (both)

5. DATA COLLECTION:
   - IRB approval (Institutional Review Board - ethics)
   - Recruit participants
   - Collect data (surveys, interviews, archival)

6. ANALYSIS:

   - Qualitative: Coding (identify themes, patterns)

7. WRITING:
   - IMRAD format: Introduction, Methods, Results, And Discussion
   - Clarity, precision (not flowery language)

8. SUBMIT TO JOURNAL:
   - Choose journal (fit, impact factor)
   - Peer review (2-3 reviewers critique)
   - Revise & resubmit (usually multiple rounds)
   - Acceptance! (6 months - 2 years from submission to publication)
