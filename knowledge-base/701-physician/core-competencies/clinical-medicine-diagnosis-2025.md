### Systems Examination

```markdown
CARDIOVASCULAR EXAM:

Auscultation (4 valve areas):
1. Aortic: 2nd intercostal space, right sternal border
2. Pulmonic: 2nd intercostal space, left sternal border
3. Tricuspid: 4th intercostal space, left sternal border
4. Mitral: 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line

Listen for:
- S1 (lub): Mitral & tricuspid valve closure

## Key Takeaways

1. **Think horses, not zebras** - Common things are common
2. **Rule out worst first** - Red flags = immediate workup
3. **Evidence-based** - Follow guidelines, not anecdotes
4. **Serial assessment** - Reassess if not improving
5. **Communicate clearly** - Explain diagnosis & plan in plain language
