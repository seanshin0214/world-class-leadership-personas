## Nursing Process

```markdown
ADPIE FRAMEWORK:

A - ASSESSMENT:
- Collect data (subjective + objective)
- Subjective: Patient reports ("I have chest pain")
- Objective: Measurable (vitals, lab results, observations)

D - DIAGNOSIS (Nursing diagnosis, not medical):
- Identify patient problems
- Format: Problem + Related to + Evidence
- Example: "Impaired gas exchange related to pneumonia as evidenced by SpO2 88%, crackles in lungs"

Common nursing diagnoses:
- Acute pain
- Risk for fall
- Impaired skin integrity
- Deficient knowledge
- Anxiety

P - PLANNING:
- Set goals (SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Example: "Patient will ambulate 50 feet with walker by discharge (3 days)"

I - IMPLEMENTATION:
- Carry out interventions
- Administer meds, perform procedures, educate patient

E - EVALUATION:
- Did patient meet goals?
- If not, revise plan
- Document outcomes

## Common Procedures

```markdown
IV INSERTION:

SUPPLIES:
- Gloves, tourniquet, alcohol swabs, IV catheter, tape, transparent dressing
- Flush (NS), extension tubing

STEPS:
1. Verify order, explain to patient
2. Select vein (hand, forearm - avoid antecubital if possible)
3. Apply tourniquet (6 inches above site)
4. Palpate vein (bouncy, not hard/ropey)
5. Clean with alcohol (30 sec, air dry)
6. Stabilize vein (thumb below, pull skin taut)
7. Insert catheter at 10-30° angle (bevel up)
8. Flash (blood return in chamber)
9. Advance catheter, retract needle
10. Release tourniquet, apply pressure above catheter
11. Connect flush, flush (check for infiltration)
12. Secure with tape, transparent dressing
13. Document (date, time, site, gauge, # attempts)

GAUGE SIZES:
- 24g (pediatric, elderly, small veins)
- 22g (most common, maintenance fluids)
- 20g (blood transfusions, surgery)
- 18g (trauma, rapid fluid resuscitation)

COMPLICATIONS:
- Infiltration (fluid leaks into tissue: swelling, cool, pale)
  * Stop IV, remove, elevate, warm compress
- Phlebitis (vein inflammation: red, warm, painful cord)
  * Remove IV, warm compress, notify provider

URINARY CATHETERIZATION (Foley):

INDICATIONS:
- Urinary retention
- Strict I&O monitoring (ICU, surgery)
- Incontinence (wound healing)
- End-of-life comfort

STEPS (Female):
1. Gather supplies, explain procedure
2. Position: Supine, knees bent, feet apart
3. Open sterile kit, don sterile gloves
4. Drape, clean labia (front to back, 3 swabs, then discard)
5. Identify urethral opening (above vagina, below clitoris)
6. Lubricate catheter tip
7. Insert 2-3 inches until urine flows
8. Inflate balloon (10 mL sterile water)
9. Gently pull back until resistance (balloon at bladder neck)
10. Secure to thigh, attach drainage bag (below bladder level)

MALE:
- Hold penis at 90° angle (straightens urethra)
- Insert 7-9 inches until urine flows

CARE:
- Empty bag q8h or when 2/3 full
- Keep bag below bladder (prevent backflow)
- Perineal care daily
- Remove ASAP (infection risk increases with duration)

COMPLICATIONS:
- CAUTI (Catheter-Associated UTI): Fever, cloudy/foul urine
  * Prevention: Sterile technique, hand hygiene, remove early

---

WOUND CARE:

ASSESSMENT:
- Location, size (length × width × depth, in cm)
- Drainage: Type (serous, sanguineous, purulent), amount (scant, moderate, copious)
- Tissue: Granulation (red, healing), Slough (yellow, dead), Eschar (black, necrotic)
- Wound edges: Approximated, undermining, tunneling
- Surrounding skin: Intact, macerated, erythema

DRESSING CHANGE:
1. Gather supplies, explain procedure
2. Remove old dressing (note drainage)
3. Clean wound (NS or wound cleanser, outside to inside)
4. Pat dry
5. Apply new dressing (per order: gauze, foam, hydrocolloid, etc.)
6. Secure with tape or wrap
7. Document

WOUND STAGES (Pressure injury):
- Stage 1: Intact skin, non-blanchable redness
- Stage 2: Partial thickness, blister or shallow ulcer
- Stage 3: Full thickness, subcutaneous fat visible
- Stage 4: Full thickness, bone/muscle/tendon visible
- Unstageable: Covered by slough/eschar (can't assess depth)

PREVENTION:
- Reposition q2h (prevent pressure ulcers)
- Keep skin clean and dry
- Nutrition (protein for healing)

## Patient Education

```markdown
DIABETES:

BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING:
- Check before meals and at bedtime (Type 1)
- Target: 80-130 mg/dL before meals, <180 2 hours after
- Rotate finger stick sites (sides of fingers, not pads)

INSULIN ADMINISTRATION:
- Rotate injection sites (abdomen fastest absorption, then arms, thighs, buttocks)
- Don't inject into same spot repeatedly (lipohypertrophy)
- Pinch skin, insert at 90° angle (45° if thin)
- Don't aspirate (SQ injection)

HYPOGLYCEMIA (Low blood sugar <70 mg/dL):
- Symptoms: Shakiness, sweating, confusion, hunger, irritability
- Treatment: 15-15 rule
  * 15g fast-acting carbs (4 oz juice, 3-4 glucose tablets, 1 Tbsp honey)
  * Wait 15 minutes, recheck glucose
  * If still low, repeat
  * Once normal, eat meal/snack (prevent recurrence)

---

HEART FAILURE:

DAILY WEIGHTS:
- Weigh every morning (same time, same scale, after urination, before eating)
- Report weight gain ≥2-3 lbs in 1 day or 5 lbs in 1 week (fluid retention)

FLUID RESTRICTION:
- Limit to 1.5-2 liters/day (per provider order)
- Include: Water, coffee, tea, soup, ice cream, jello
- Tips: Use smaller cups, suck on ice chips, hard candy

MEDICATIONS:
- Take diuretics in morning (frequent urination daytime)
- Don't skip doses (even if feeling better)

DIET:
- Low sodium (<2000 mg/day)
- Avoid: Canned soups, deli meats, fast food, salty snacks
- Read labels (watch for hidden sodium)

---

POST-OPERATIVE:

INCENTIVE SPIROMETER:
- Use every hour while awake (10 times)
- Goal: 2500 mL (or prescribed volume)
- Purpose: Prevent pneumonia, atelectasis
- Technique: Deep breath in (hold 3-5 sec), exhale slowly

SPLINTING INCISION:
- Support incision with pillow when coughing, sneezing, moving
- Reduces pain, prevents dehiscence (wound opening)

ACTIVITY:
- Dangle legs before standing (prevent orthostatic hypotension)
- Ambulate 3-4 times daily (prevent blood clots, pneumonia)
- Use incentive spirometer after ambulation

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
- Take pain meds before pain becomes severe (easier to control)
- Don't wait until pain is 10/10
- Use non-pharmacological: Ice, heat, distraction, positioning

SIGNS OF INFECTION (Call provider):
- Fever >100.4°F
- Redness, warmth, swelling at incision
- Purulent drainage (pus)
- Increased pain

## Key Takeaways

1. **Safety first** - 5 rights of medication (every single time, no shortcuts)
2. **Communication** - SBAR format (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation)
3. **Documentation** - If not documented, didn't happen (legal protection)
4. **Infection control** - Hand hygiene (before/after every patient, 20 seconds)
5. **Patient advocacy** - Speak up (question orders if concerned, escalate if needed)
