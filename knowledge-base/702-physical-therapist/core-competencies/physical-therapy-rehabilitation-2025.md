## Initial Evaluation

```markdown
SUBJECTIVE (History):

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
- "What brings you in today?"
- Patient's words (document verbatim)
- Example: "Lower back pain for 3 months"

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS (HPI):
- Onset: When did it start? How? (sudden vs gradual)
- Location: Where exactly? (point to body part)
- Duration: Constant or intermittent?
- Characteristics: Sharp, dull, aching, burning, shooting?
- Aggravating factors: What makes it worse? (bending, sitting, walking)
- Relieving factors: What helps? (rest, ice, medication)

- Recreation? (golf, gardening, playing with grandkids)

GOALS:
- What do you want to achieve?
- "Return to running 3 miles"
- "Pick up grandkids without pain"
- "Sleep through night"
- SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

OBJECTIVE (Physical exam):

OBSERVATION:
- Posture (forward head, rounded shoulders, pelvic tilt)
- Gait (limping, antalgic gait to avoid pain)
- Asymmetry (one shoulder higher, scoliosis)
- Swelling, bruising, redness
- Assistive device (cane, walker, crutches)

PALPATION (Touch):
- Tenderness (where exactly?)
- Muscle spasm (tight, guarding)
- Temperature (warm = inflammation, cool = circulation issue)
- Edema (swelling, pitting or non-pitting)

RANGE OF MOTION (ROM):
- Active (patient moves): Assess strength, willingness to move
- Passive (therapist moves): Assess joint mobility, end-feel
- Measure with goniometer (degrees)

Normal ROM (examples):
- Shoulder flexion: 180°
- Shoulder abduction: 180°
- Elbow flexion: 150°
- Hip flexion: 120°
- Knee flexion: 135°
- Ankle dorsiflexion: 20°

END-FEEL:
- Soft (muscle/tissue): Elbow flexion (biceps limit)
- Firm (ligament/capsule): Knee extension (ligaments limit)
- Hard (bone-to-bone): Elbow extension (olecranon hits fossa)
- Empty (pain stops movement): Acute injury

MANUAL MUSCLE TESTING (MMT):
- 0/5: No contraction
- 1/5: Flicker of contraction (no movement)
- 2/5: Movement with gravity eliminated (side-lying)
- 3/5: Movement against gravity (no resistance)
- 4/5: Movement against gravity + some resistance
- 5/5: Normal strength (full resistance)

SPECIAL TESTS (Orthopedic):

SHOULDER:
- Empty Can Test (Supraspinatus tear)
- Hawkins-Kennedy (Impingement)
- Neer Test (Impingement)
- Apprehension Test (Instability)

KNEE:
- Lachman Test (ACL tear)
- Anterior Drawer (ACL)
- McMurray Test (Meniscus tear)
- Valgus/Varus Stress (Ligament integrity)

SPINE:
- Straight Leg Raise (Sciatica, disc herniation)
- Slump Test (Neural tension)
- Spurling Test (Cervical radiculopathy)

NEUROLOGICAL:
- Sensation (dermatomes: L4, L5, S1 legs; C5-T1 arms)
- Reflexes (patellar, Achilles, biceps, triceps)
  * 0: Absent
  * 1+: Diminished
  * 2+: Normal
  * 3+: Brisk
  * 4+: Hyperactive (clonus)
- Myotomes (muscle innervation: C5 shoulder abduction, L4 ankle dorsiflexion)

FUNCTIONAL TESTS:
- Sit to stand (5× in 30 sec, norm 12-15)
- Gait speed (4-meter walk, <0.8 m/s = fall risk)
- Timed Up and Go (TUG): Stand from chair, walk 3 meters, turn, return, sit
  * <10 sec: Normal
  * 10-20 sec: Mild impairment
  * >20 sec: High fall risk
- Balance (single-leg stance: 30 sec norm, <5 sec = impaired)

---

ASSESSMENT (Clinical reasoning):

DIAGNOSIS (PT diagnosis, not medical):
- Impairments: Decreased ROM, strength, balance
- Functional limitations: Unable to walk >10 min, difficulty stairs
- Example: "Lumbar strain with decreased hip flexion ROM and core weakness limiting ability to sit >30 min"

PROGNOSIS:
- Expected outcome
- Timeframe (6-8 weeks)
- Frequency (2-3× per week)

PLAN:
- Interventions (exercises, manual therapy, modalities)
- Patient education
- Discharge criteria

## Treatment Interventions

```markdown
THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE:

STRENGTHENING:

PROGRESSION:
1. Isometric (muscle contracts, no joint movement)
   - Example: Quad set (tighten thigh, hold 5 sec)
2. Isotonic (concentric + eccentric, joint moves)
   - Example: Bicep curl (lift + lower)
3. Isokinetic (constant speed, specialized equipment)
4. Functional (task-specific)
   - Example: Sit-to-stand, stairs

DOSAGE:
- Endurance: 2-3 sets × 15-20 reps (light weight)
- Hypertrophy (muscle size): 3-4 sets × 8-12 reps (moderate weight)
- Strength: 4-5 sets × 3-6 reps (heavy weight)
- Rest: 30-90 sec between sets

COMMON EXERCISES:

CORE:
- Plank (30-60 sec)
- Dead bug (alternate arm/leg)
- Bird dog (opposite arm/leg extend)
- Bridges (glute activation)

LOWER EXTREMITY:
- Squats (body weight → weighted)
- Lunges (forward, reverse, lateral)
- Calf raises
- Leg press
- Step-ups

UPPER EXTREMITY:
- Rows (scapular retraction)
- Shoulder external rotation (rotator cuff)
- Wall push-ups → Standard push-ups
- Overhead press

BALANCE:
- Single-leg stance (eyes open → eyes closed)
- Tandem stance (heel-to-toe)
- Balance board
- BAPS board (ankle proprioception)

---

STRETCHING:

STATIC STRETCHING:
- Hold 30 sec
- Gentle (no bouncing)
- After warm-up (cold muscles tear easier)

EXAMPLES:
- Hamstring: Sit, reach for toes
- Hip flexor: Lunge position, push hips forward
- Calf: Wall push-up position, back leg straight
- Pec: Doorway stretch, arm at 90°

DYNAMIC STRETCHING:
- Movement-based (leg swings, arm circles)
- Before activity (warm-up)

PROPRIOCEPTIVE NEUROMUSCULAR FACILITATION (PNF):
- Contract-Relax:
  1. Stretch muscle to limit
  2. Patient contracts against resistance (6 sec)
  3. Relax
  4. Stretch further (increased ROM)
- More effective than static (neurophysiology)

---

MANUAL THERAPY:

SOFT TISSUE MOBILIZATION:
- Massage (increase blood flow, reduce tension)
- Myofascial release (sustained pressure on tight fascia)
- Trigger point release (pressure on muscle knots)

JOINT MOBILIZATION:
- Grades:
  * I: Small amplitude, beginning of ROM (pain modulation)
  * II: Larger amplitude, mid-ROM (pain modulation)
  * III: Large amplitude, to end of ROM (increase mobility)
  * IV: Small amplitude, at end of ROM (increase mobility)
  * V: Thrust (manipulation, "crack" joint) - requires additional training

INDICATIONS:
- Decreased joint ROM (capsular restriction)
- Pain (Grades I-II)

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
- Fracture, infection, tumor
- Hypermobility (already too flexible)
- Acute inflammation

---

MODALITIES (Adjuncts, not primary treatment):

HEAT (Thermotherapy):
- Hot pack, heating pad (superficial)
- Ultrasound (deep heat, penetrates 3-5 cm)
- Effects: Increase blood flow, relax muscles, decrease pain
- Use: Chronic pain, stiffness
- Contraindications: Acute injury (<48 hours), infection, malignancy

COLD (Cryotherapy):
- Ice pack, ice massage
- Effects: Decrease inflammation, swelling, pain (numbing)
- Use: Acute injury (first 48-72 hours), post-exercise
- Duration: 15-20 min (longer = tissue damage)
- Contraindications: Circulatory disorders, cold hypersensitivity

ELECTRICAL STIMULATION (E-STIM):
- TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation):
  * Pain relief (gate control theory)
  * Patient can use at home
- NMES (Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation):
  * Muscle re-education (post-surgery, stroke)
  * Prevent atrophy

ULTRASOUND:
- Deep heat (vibration, penetrates tissue)
- Promote healing (increase blood flow)
- Phonophoresis (drive medication through skin)

CAUTION:
- Modalities are passive (patient doesn't do anything)
- Focus on active treatment (exercise, education)
- Research shows limited long-term benefit

## Common Conditions

```markdown
LOW BACK PAIN:

ASSESSMENT:
- Red flags (rule out serious pathology):
  * Age >50 or <20 (cancer, fracture risk)
  * Trauma (fall, car accident)
  * Fever, unexplained weight loss (infection, tumor)
  * Bladder/bowel dysfunction (cauda equina, emergency!)
  * Progressive neurological deficit (surgery consult)

MECHANICAL (90% of cases):
- Muscle strain (lifting, awkward movement)
- Facet joint pain (extension worse)
- Disc herniation (flexion worse, leg pain)

TREATMENT:
- Stay active (bed rest worsens, move within tolerance)
- Core strengthening (transverse abdominis, multifidus)
- McKenzie exercises (directional preference)
  * If flexion better: Cat-cow, knee-to-chest
  * If extension better: Prone press-ups
- Manual therapy (joint mobilization, soft tissue)
- Education (proper lifting, ergonomics)

---

KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA):

SIGNS/SYMPTOMS:
- Pain with weight-bearing (stairs, prolonged standing)
- Stiffness (morning, after sitting)
- Crepitus (grinding, cracking)
- Swelling

TREATMENT:
- Quad strengthening (VMO activation)
  * Straight leg raises
  * Short-arc quads (roll under knee, extend)
- Low-impact aerobic (walking, swimming, cycling)
- Weight loss (if overweight: 1 lb lost = 4 lb less force on knee)
- Balance training (prevent falls)
- Manual therapy (patellar mobilization)
- Assistive device (cane in opposite hand)

PROGRESSION:
- Conservative PT → Injections (corticosteroid, hyaluronic acid) → Total knee replacement (TKR)

---

POST-SURGICAL (Total Knee Replacement):

PHASES:

PHASE 1 (Weeks 0-2, Hospital/Home):
- Goals: Decrease pain/swelling, protect incision, restore ROM
- Exercises:
  * Ankle pumps (prevent DVT)
  * Quad sets, glute sets
  * Heel slides (flexion ROM)
  * Straight leg raise (when quad control)
- Gait: Walker → Cane → No device
- ROM goal: 0° extension, 90° flexion

PHASE 2 (Weeks 3-6, Outpatient PT):
- Goals: Increase ROM (0-120°), strength, function
- Exercises:
  * Stationary bike (increase ROM)
  * Mini squats
  * Step-ups (start 4 inches, progress)
  * Balance (single-leg stance)
- Gait training (normal pattern, no limp)

PHASE 3 (Weeks 7-12+):
- Goals: Return to activities (walking, golf, gardening)
- Exercises:
  * Advance strength (squats, lunges, leg press)
  * Functional (stairs, inclines, uneven surfaces)
  * Recreation (gradual return)
- Discharge: Independent with home exercise program (HEP)

---

STROKE (CVA):

IMPAIRMENTS:
- Hemiplegia (paralysis one side)
- Spasticity (tight, hyperactive muscles)
- Decreased balance
- Gait deviations (foot drop, circumduction)

TREATMENT:
- Neuroplasticity (brain rewires, repetition essential)
- Task-specific training (practice actual functional tasks)
- Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT): Force use of affected arm (restrain good arm)
- Gait training:
  * Weight shift to affected side
  * AFO (Ankle-Foot Orthosis) for foot drop
  * Assistive device (quad cane, hemi-walker)
- Balance: Sitting → standing → walking
- Functional electrical stimulation (FES): E-stim during gait (dorsiflexion)

RECOVERY:
- Most recovery first 3-6 months (neuroplasticity highest)
- Continue PT 6-12+ months (gains possible for years)

## Patient Education

```markdown
ERGONOMICS (Prevent re-injury):

LIFTING:
- Bend knees, not back (squat, keep spine neutral)
- Hold object close to body (less torque on spine)
- Avoid twisting (turn feet, pivot with whole body)
- Get help if heavy (>25 lbs for most)

SITTING (Desk work):
- Chair: Feet flat on floor, knees 90°, lumbar support
- Monitor: Eye level (top of screen at or below eye level)
- Keyboard/mouse: Elbows 90°, wrists neutral
- Breaks: Stand, walk every 30-60 min (avoid prolonged static posture)

SLEEPING:
- Mattress: Medium-firm (not too soft, not rock hard)
- Pillow: Supports neck curve
- Position:
  * Back sleeper: Pillow under knees (reduce low back strain)
  * Side sleeper: Pillow between knees (align hips)
  * Avoid stomach (twists neck)

---

HOME EXERCISE PROGRAM (HEP):

COMPLIANCE TIPS:
- Keep simple (3-5 exercises, not 20)
- Demonstrate + provide handout (pictures, written instructions)
- Frequency: 2-3× daily (short sessions better than 1 long)
- Integrate into routine ("During TV commercials", "Before bed")
- Track progress (journal, app, check off calendar)

PROGRESSION:
- Increase reps, sets
- Add resistance (resistance bands, weights)
- Increase duration (hold plank longer)
- Decrease support (balance eyes open → eyes closed)

PAIN MONITORING:
- "Good" pain: Muscle fatigue, mild soreness (1-3/10)
- "Bad" pain: Sharp, shooting, increases significantly (>5/10, or lasts >2 hours after exercise)
- Rule: If pain increases during or after, reduce intensity
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Movement is medicine** - Stay active (rest worsens most conditions)
2. **Patient-centered goals** - What matters to them? (not just ROM/strength numbers)
3. **Education empowers** - Teach why (not just what), prevent recurrence
4. **Active over passive** - Exercise > modalities (long-term outcomes)
5. **Dosage matters** - Too little = no change, too much = injury (find sweet spot)
