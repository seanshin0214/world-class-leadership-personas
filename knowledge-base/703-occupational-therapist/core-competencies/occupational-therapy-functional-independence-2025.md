## Occupational Therapy Overview

```markdown
WHAT IS OT?

Occupational Therapy helps people:
- Perform daily activities (ADLs)
- Return to work
- Participate in meaningful occupations

"Occupation" = Purposeful activity (not just job)
- Self-care (dressing, bathing, eating)
- Work (job tasks, school)
- Leisure (hobbies, social activities)

OT vs PT:
- PT: Mobility, strength, pain (body functions)
- OT: Function, independence, daily tasks (doing activities)
- Example: PT helps walk, OT helps cook using that walking ability

---

PRACTICE SETTINGS:

PEDIATRIC:
- Schools (sensory, fine motor, handwriting)
- Clinics (developmental delays, autism)
- Early intervention (0-3 years)

ADULT:
- Hospitals (post-surgery, stroke, trauma)
- Outpatient clinics (hand therapy, work conditioning)
- Home health (ADL training in home environment)
- Mental health (coping skills, daily routines)

GERIATRIC:
- Skilled nursing facilities (post-hospital)
- Assisted living (maintain independence)
- Memory care (dementia, safety)

SPECIALTY AREAS:
- Hand therapy (certified hand therapist, CHT)
- Driving rehabilitation
- Low vision (visual impairments)
- Lymphedema management

---

ASSESSMENT:

FIM (Functional Independence Measure):
- 18 items (13 motor, 5 cognitive)
- 7-point scale:
  * 7: Complete independence
  * 6: Modified independence (device, extra time)
  * 5: Supervision (cues, setup)
  * 4: Minimal assist (<25% help)
  * 3: Moderate assist (25-50%)
  * 2: Maximal assist (50-75%)
  * 1: Total assist (>75% or 2+ people)

EXAMPLE: Dressing
- 7: Dresses independently, no adaptive equipment
- 6: Uses button hook, sock aid (devices)
- 5: Needs verbal cues ("Don't forget your pants")
- 4: Therapist hands shirt, patient puts on
- 3: Therapist pulls shirt over head, patient pushes arms through
- 2: Therapist does most, patient assists minimally
- 1: Therapist dresses patient completely

---

ADL TRAINING:

DRESSING:

HEMIPLEGIA (one-sided weakness/paralysis):
- Technique: "Dress affected side first, undress affected side last"
- Rationale: Easier to manipulate clothing with strong arm

EXAMPLE (Right-sided weakness, putting on shirt):
1. Place shirt in lap, inside out
2. Put RIGHT arm (weak) into sleeve first
3. Pull shirt behind back
4. Put LEFT arm (strong) into sleeve
5. Pull shirt over head

ADAPTIVE TECHNIQUES:
- Elastic waistbands (no zipper/button)
- Velcro shoes (instead of laces)
- Front-opening shirts (easier than pullover)
- Button hook (arthritis, weak grip)
- Sock aid (can't reach feet, hip precautions)

BATHING:

SAFETY:
- Shower chair (reduce fall risk)
- Grab bars (support transferring in/out)
- Non-slip mat (prevent slips)
- Handheld showerhead (reach all areas while seated)

TECHNIQUE:
- Sit to wash (conserve energy, reduce fall risk)
- Long-handled sponge (reach feet, back)
- Wash from top to bottom (hair → body → feet)
- Pat dry (rubbing = fatigue)

ONE-HANDED TECHNIQUE:
- Pump soap bottles (easier than bar soap)
- Terry cloth robe (absorbs water while drying)

TOILETING:

EQUIPMENT:
- Raised toilet seat (3-4 inches, easier sit→stand)
- Grab bars (next to toilet, support transfers)
- Bedside commode (if bathroom too far, at night)

TECHNIQUE:
- Approach toilet backward
- Use grab bars to lower (don't plop down)
- Rise by pushing off grab bars (not leaning forward excessively)

WIPING (One-handed):
- Toilet paper aid (long handle, holds paper)
- Bidet (spray, no wiping needed)

FEEDING:

ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT:
- Built-up utensils (foam handle, easier grip for arthritis/weak grip)
- Weighted utensils (tremor control, Parkinson's)
- Rocker knife (cut with one hand, rocking motion)
- Scoop plate (raised edge, prevents food from falling off)
- Non-slip mat (under plate, stability)

TECHNIQUE:
- Chin tuck (swallowing, reduce aspiration risk)
- Small bites (easier to manage, chew thoroughly)
- Alternate liquids/solids (clear throat)
- Sit upright 90° (gravity assists swallowing)
```

SENSORY INTEGRATION:

SENSORY SYSTEMS:
1. Tactile (touch)
2. Vestibular (movement, balance)
3. Proprioception (body awareness, joint position)
4. Auditory (sound)
5. Visual (sight)
6. Olfactory (smell)
7. Gustatory (taste)

SENSORY PROCESSING DISORDER (SPD):

OVER-RESPONSIVE (Sensory avoider):
- Symptoms:
  * Avoids touch (tags, textures, hugs)
  * Covers ears (loud sounds)
  * Picky eater (textures)
  * Dislikes messy play (finger paint, sand)
- Intervention:
  * Gradual exposure (desensitization)
  * Deep pressure (calming, hugs, weighted blanket)
  * Quiet space (reduce overstimulation)

UNDER-RESPONSIVE (Sensory seeker):
- Symptoms:
  * Constantly moving (fidgeting, jumping)
  * Touches everything (seeks input)
  * Rough play (crashes into things)
  * High pain tolerance
- Intervention:
  * Sensory diet (scheduled sensory activities)
  * Heavy work (push/pull, carry heavy items)
  * Fidgets (squeeze ball, tactile toys)
  * Movement breaks (jump on trampoline q20min)

---

SENSORY DIET (Daily activities):

ALERTING (Increase arousal):
- Cold (ice, cold water)
- Fast movement (swing, spinning)
- Crunchy foods (carrots, pretzels)
- Bright lights, loud music

CALMING (Decrease arousal):
- Warm (warm bath, heating pad)
- Slow, rhythmic movement (rocking)
- Heavy work (push wall, carry books)
- Dim lights, soft music
- Chewy foods (gum, bagel)

ORGANIZING (Focus, attention):
- Proprioception (joint compression, bear hugs)
- Rhythmic activities (marching, drumming)

EXAMPLE SENSORY DIET (ADHD, under-responsive):
- Morning: Jump on trampoline 5 min (alerting)
- Before homework: Animal walks (bear crawl, crab walk) - proprioception
- During homework: Fidget (stress ball, chew pencil topper)
- Before bed: Weighted blanket (calming)

---

AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD):

COMMON OT GOALS:
- Sensory regulation (tolerate sensory input)
- Social skills (turn-taking, eye contact)
- Fine motor (coloring, writing, cutting)
- Self-care (dressing, toileting)
- Adaptive behavior (transitions, following routines)

INTERVENTIONS:
- Visual schedules (pictures show daily routine)
- Social stories (teach expected behavior in scenarios)
- First-Then board ("First homework, Then iPad")
- Timer (visual time, help with transitions)
- Sensory breaks (calm space, weighted lap pad)
```

## Cognitive & Perceptual Training

```markdown
COGNITIVE DOMAINS:

ATTENTION:
- Sustained (focus over time)
- Selective (filter distractions)
- Divided (multitask)
- Alternating (switch between tasks)

MEMORY:
- Short-term (hold info seconds)
- Working memory (manipulate info, e.g., mental math)
- Long-term (retrieve stored info)

EXECUTIVE FUNCTION:
- Planning (sequence steps)
- Organization (categorize, prioritize)
- Problem-solving
- Inhibition (impulse control)

---

DEFICITS (Post-stroke, TBI, dementia):

ATTENTION DEFICITS:
- Symptoms: Easily distracted, can't finish tasks
- Interventions:
  * Reduce distractions (quiet room)
  * Break tasks into steps
  * Use timer (focus 10 min, then break)

MEMORY DEFICITS:
- Symptoms: Forget appointments, repeat questions, misplace items
- Interventions:
  * External aids (calendar, alarms, checklists)
  * Memory notebook (write everything down)
  * Routine (same place for keys/wallet)
  * Spaced retrieval (practice remembering, increase intervals)

EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION:
- Symptoms: Poor planning, disorganized, impulsive
- Interventions:
  * Checklists (visual guide, check off steps)
  * Problem-solving training (identify problem, brainstorm, evaluate)
  * Errorless learning (prevent mistakes, build confidence)

---

VISUAL PERCEPTUAL DEFICITS:

HEMIANOPSIA (Loss of half visual field, e.g., right side):
- Interventions:
  * Scanning training (turn head, look to affected side)
  * Visual anchors (red line on left side of page, scan left)
  * Environment setup (place items on good side)

UNILATERAL NEGLECT:
- Ignores one side (usually left)
- Interventions:
  * Awareness training (point out neglected side)
  * Anchor objects on neglected side (forces attention)
  * Tactile cues (touch left arm, "This is your left side")
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Function-focused** - Not just ROM/strength, but can you dress yourself? (meaningful tasks)
2. **Adapt the task** - If can't do normally, modify (one-handed techniques, equipment)
3. **Modify the environment** - Home modifications prevent barriers (ramps, grab bars)
4. **Client-centered** - What matters to them? (grandma wants to cook, not just grip strength)
5. **Sensory awareness** - Behavior often sensory-driven (seek/avoid input, adjust accordingly)
