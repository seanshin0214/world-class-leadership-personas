## Medication Review & Reconciliation

```
MEDICATION RECONCILIATION PROCESS:

1. OBTAIN COMPLETE MEDICATION HISTORY:
   □ Prescription medications (name, dose, frequency, route)
   □ Over-the-counter medications
   □ Herbal supplements
   □ Vitamins & minerals
   □ PRN medications (as needed)
   □ Discontinued medications (when & why)

2. ASSESS FOR:
   □ Drug-drug interactions
   □ Drug-disease interactions
   □ Duplicate therapy
   □ Inappropriate dosing (renal/hepatic adjustment)
   □ Therapeutic gaps (missing indicated meds)
   □ Adherence issues

3. INTERVENE:
   □ Contact prescriber with recommendations
   □ Patient counseling
   □ Therapeutic substitution (if protocol allows)
   □ Document interventions

4. FOLLOW-UP:
   □ Monitor for effectiveness
   □ Monitor for adverse effects
   □ Reassess at each encounter

## Common Drug Classes

### Antihypertensives

```markdown
ACE INHIBITORS (-pril): Lisinopril, Enalapril

MECHANISM: Block angiotensin-converting enzyme → ↓ Angiotensin II → vasodilation

INDICATIONS:
- Hypertension (first-line)
- Heart failure (reduces mortality)
- Post-MI
- Diabetic nephropathy (renoprotective)

DOSING:
- Lisinopril: 10-40 mg once daily
- Start low in elderly, renal impairment

ADVERSE EFFECTS:
- Dry cough (10-15% of patients) → Switch to ARB
- Hyperkalemia (monitor K+ especially with CKD)
- Angioedema (rare, <1%, but life-threatening)
- Acute kidney injury (if bilateral renal artery stenosis)
- Teratogenic (Category D/X in pregnancy)

MONITORING:
- Blood pressure (target <140/90, <130/80 if diabetes)
- Creatinine & K+ (check at baseline, 1-2 weeks after initiation, then periodically)
- Acceptable Cr increase: <30% from baseline

DRUG INTERACTIONS:
⚠️ NSAIDs: Reduce antihypertensive effect, increase AKI risk
⚠️ Potassium supplements/spironolactone: Hyperkalemia
⚠️ Aliskiren (if diabetic): Contraindicated

PATIENT COUNSELING:
"Take once daily, same time each day. May take 2-4 weeks to see full effect.
Common side effect is dry cough - let me know if bothersome.
Avoid potassium supplements and salt substitutes (contain potassium).
Stand up slowly to prevent dizziness.
If pregnant or planning pregnancy, notify provider immediately."

## Drug Interactions

### Cytochrome P450 System

```markdown
MAJOR CYP450 ENZYMES:

CYP3A4 (metabolizes 50% of drugs):

SUBSTRATES (drugs metabolized by 3A4):
- Statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin)
- Calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, diltiazem)
- Immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, tacrolimus)
- Benzodiazepines (midazolam, alprazolam)
- Anticoagulants (rivaroxaban, apixaban)

INHIBITORS (↑ drug levels):
Strong: Ketoconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, grapefruit juice
Moderate: Fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin
→ Result: ↑ substrate levels → toxicity

Example: Clarithromycin + simvastatin → ↑ statin levels → rhabdomyolysis
Solution: Switch to azithromycin (no 3A4 interaction) or pravastatin (not 3A4)

INDUCERS (↓ drug levels):
Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's Wort
→ Result: ↓ substrate levels → treatment failure

Example: Oral contraceptives + St. John's Wort → ↓ contraceptive levels → pregnancy
Solution: Advise backup contraception or discontinue St. John's Wort

---

CYP2D6 (metabolizes ~25% of drugs):

SUBSTRATES:
- Antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine, venlafaxine)
- Beta-blockers (metoprolol, carvedilol)
- Opioids (codeine, tramadol, hydrocodone)
- Antipsychotics (risperidone, haloperidol)

INHIBITORS:
Strong: Fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, quinidine

Example: Codeine + fluoxetine → Codeine requires 2D6 to convert to morphine (active)
→ Reduced pain relief
Solution: Use opioid not requiring 2D6 (morphine, oxycodone)

GENETIC POLYMORPHISM:
- Poor metabolizers (5-10% Caucasians): ↑ drug levels
- Ultra-rapid metabolizers (1-2% Caucasians, 10-30% North Africans): ↓ drug levels

---

CYP2C9:

SUBSTRATES:
- Warfarin
- Phenytoin
- NSAIDs

INHIBITORS: Fluconazole, amiodarone

Example: Warfarin + fluconazole → ↑ INR → bleeding
Solution: ↓ warfarin dose by 25-50%, monitor INR closely
```

### Pharmacodynamic Interactions

```markdown
SEROTONIN SYNDROME:

CAUSES: Combining serotonergic agents
- SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline)
- SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine)
- MAOIs
- Tramadol, meperidine
- Linezolid (antibiotic with MAOI activity)
- St. John's Wort

SYMPTOMS (Triad):
1. Mental status changes (agitation, confusion)
2. Autonomic instability (hyperthermia, tachycardia, diaphoresis)
3. Neuromuscular hyperactivity (tremor, clonus, hyperreflexia)

MANAGEMENT:
- Discontinue serotonergic agents
- Supportive care (fluids, cooling)
- Cyproheptadine (serotonin antagonist) if severe

PREVENTION:
- 2-week washout when switching from SSRI to MAOI
- 5-week washout for fluoxetine (long half-life)

---

QT PROLONGATION:

HIGH-RISK DRUGS:
- Antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, sotalol)
- Antibiotics (azithromycin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin)
- Antipsychotics (haloperidol, quetiapine, ziprasidone)
- Antidepressants (citalopram >40 mg/day)
- Antiemetics (ondansetron)

RISK FACTORS:
- Baseline QTc >450 ms (men) or >470 ms (women)
- Electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia)
- Female sex
- Bradycardia
- Structural heart disease

CONSEQUENCES: Torsades de pointes (polymorphic VTach) → sudden cardiac death

MANAGEMENT:
- Check baseline ECG if >1 QT-prolonging drug
- Monitor K+ and Mg2+ (replete if low)
- Avoid combinations when possible
- Consider dose reduction

---

BLEEDING RISK:

ANTICOAGULANTS + ANTIPLATELET:
Warfarin + aspirin → 2-3x ↑ bleeding risk

Triple therapy (warfarin + aspirin + clopidogrel):
- Use only if essential (e.g., post-PCI with atrial fibrillation)
- Shortest duration possible (<1 year)
- PPI for GI protection

ANTICOAGULANTS + NSAIDs:
- 3-4x ↑ GI bleeding risk
- Avoid if possible
- If needed: Use lowest NSAID dose, shortest duration, add PPI

SSRIs + ANTICOAGULANTS:
- SSRIs inhibit platelet aggregation → ↑ bleeding
- Monitor closely
```

## Renal Dosing Adjustments

```python
def calculate_egfr(age, sex, creatinine):
    """
    CKD-EPI equation for eGFR (mL/min/1.73m²)
    """
    k = 0.7 if sex == 'female' else 0.9
    alpha = -0.329 if sex == 'female' else -0.411
    
    min_term = min(creatinine / k, 1) ** alpha
    max_term = max(creatinine / k, 1) ** (-1.209)
    age_factor = 0.993 ** age
    sex_factor = 1.018 if sex == 'female' else 1
    
    egfr = 141 * min_term * max_term * age_factor * sex_factor
    return round(egfr, 1)

# CKD Stages
def ckd_stage(egfr):
    if egfr >= 90:
        return "Stage 1 (Normal)"
    elif egfr >= 60:
        return "Stage 2 (Mild)"
    elif egfr >= 45:
        return "Stage 3a (Mild-Moderate)"
    elif egfr >= 30:
        return "Stage 3b (Moderate-Severe)"
    elif egfr >= 15:
        return "Stage 4 (Severe)"
    else:
        return "Stage 5 (Kidney Failure)"

# Example
egfr = calculate_egfr(age=75, sex='female', creatinine=1.5)
print(f"eGFR: {egfr} mL/min/1.73m² - {ckd_stage(egfr)}")
# eGFR: 37.4 mL/min/1.73m² - Stage 3b (Moderate-Severe)

# Drug dosing adjustments for eGFR 37:
adjustments = {
    'Metformin': 'Reduce dose or discontinue if <30',
    'Gabapentin': 'Reduce to 300mg TID (from 300mg QID)',
    'Enoxaparin': 'Reduce to 1 mg/kg daily (from 1 mg/kg BID)',
    'Digoxin': 'Reduce dose by 50%',
}
```

## Patient Counseling Points

```markdown
ANTIBIOTICS:

"Take exactly as prescribed, even if feeling better.
Complete the full course (don't stop early → resistance).
Take [with/without] food.
Common side effects: Nausea, diarrhea.
If diarrhea is severe or bloody, call provider (C. diff risk).
Avoid alcohol with metronidazole (severe nausea/vomiting)."

WARFARIN:

"Take at same time each day (usually evening).
Requires regular INR monitoring.
Be consistent with vitamin K intake (leafy greens).
Avoid cranberry juice (↑ INR).
Notify all providers you're on warfarin.
Avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) - use acetaminophen for pain.
Signs of bleeding: Easy bruising, nosebleeds, blood in urine/stool, black tarry stools.
If fall or head injury, seek immediate care."

STATINS:

"Take once daily, usually in evening (cholesterol made at night).
May cause muscle pain - report if severe.
Avoid grapefruit juice with simvastatin, atorvastatin, lovastatin.
May take 4-6 weeks to see full cholesterol-lowering effect.
Liver tests monitored periodically."

INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS (asthma/COPD):

"Rinse mouth after each use (prevent thrush).
Use daily even if feeling well (controller medication, not rescue).
Shake inhaler before use.
If using rescue inhaler >2x/week, asthma not well-controlled - see provider."
