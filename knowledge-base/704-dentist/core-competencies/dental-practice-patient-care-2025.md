## Dental Examination

```markdown
COMPREHENSIVE ORAL EXAM:

MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Medical conditions (diabetes, heart disease, bleeding disorders)
- Medications (blood thinners, bisphosphonates, antibiotics)
- Allergies (latex, medications, local anesthetics)
- Previous dental experiences (anxiety, complications)

RED FLAGS (Require medical clearance or antibiotics):
- Heart valve replacement, pacemaker (endocarditis risk)
- Joint replacement <2 years (infection risk)
- Recent radiation therapy (head/neck)
- Immunocompromised (HIV, chemotherapy)
- Pregnancy (elective procedures wait until 2nd trimester)

---

EXTRAORAL EXAM:

INSPECTION:
- Symmetry (facial, TMJ)
- Lymph nodes (palpate submandibular, cervical - swollen = infection/cancer)
- TMJ (temporomandibular joint):
  * Open/close (normal: 40-50mm opening, 3 fingers width)
  * Clicking, popping (disc displacement)
  * Pain, limited movement (TMD - temporomandibular disorder)
- Skin (lesions, asymmetry suspicious for oral cancer)

---

INTRAORAL EXAM:

SOFT TISSUE:
- Lips, cheeks, tongue, palate, floor of mouth
- Look for:
  * White patches (leukoplakia - precancerous)
  * Red patches (erythroplakia - more concerning, higher cancer risk)
  * Ulcers >2 weeks (biopsy, rule out cancer)
  * Black/brown spots (melanoma rare, but possible)

GINGIVA (Gums):
- Color: Pink (healthy), red (inflammation - gingivitis)
- Texture: Stippled/firm (healthy), smooth/swollen (disease)
- Bleeding on probing (BOP): Sign of inflammation
- Recession (root exposure, sensitivity)

TEETH:
- Missing teeth (record chart)
- Caries (cavities): Visual, tactile (explorer), x-ray
- Restorations (fillings, crowns): Check integrity, margins
- Mobility (grade 0-3):
  * 0: Normal (0.1mm movement)
  * 1: Slight (0.2-1mm)
  * 2: Moderate (1-2mm, horizontal)
  * 3: Severe (>2mm, horizontal + vertical, poor prognosis)

PERIODONTAL EXAM:
- Probing depths (measure pocket depth, 6 sites per tooth):
  * 1-3mm: Healthy
  * 4-5mm: Early periodontitis
  * 6+mm: Moderate-severe periodontitis
- Attachment loss (distance from CEJ to pocket base)
- Furcation involvement (bone loss between roots, molars)

OCCLUSION (Bite):
- Class I: Normal (lower molar 1/2 tooth ahead of upper)
- Class II: Overbite (lower jaw back, "buck teeth")
- Class III: Underbite (lower jaw forward)
- Crossbite, open bite, deep bite

---

RADIOGRAPHS (X-rays):

TYPES:
- Bitewing (2-4 x-rays, check cavities between teeth, bone level)
  * Frequency: 6-12 months (high caries risk), 12-24 months (low risk)
- Periapical (full tooth, root to crown, check infection, bone loss)
- Panoramic (entire mouth, jaw, sinuses, TMJ)
  * Use: Impacted wisdom teeth, fractures, pathology

FINDINGS:
- Caries (radiolucency - dark, demineralization)
- Bone loss (horizontal, vertical, furcation)
- Periapical radiolucency (infection at root tip - abscess)
- Impacted teeth
- Cysts, tumors (rare)

RADIATION SAFETY:
- ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable)
- Lead apron, thyroid collar
- Digital x-rays (80-90% less radiation than film)

## Common Dental Procedures

```markdown
PROPHYLAXIS (Cleaning):

SCALING:
- Remove calculus (tartar) above gumline
- Ultrasonic scaler (vibrates, water spray)
- Hand instruments (sickle scaler, curette)

POLISHING:
- Rubber cup + polishing paste (removes stains, plaque)
- Prophy paste (coarse → fine grit)

ROOT PLANING (Deep cleaning, periodontal disease):
- Scale + smooth root surface below gumline
- Remove bacteria, toxins
- May require local anesthesia (LA)
- Quadrant by quadrant (4 visits) or full mouth (sedation)

---

RESTORATIVE (Fillings):

INDICATIONS:
- Caries (cavities)
- Fractured tooth
- Worn tooth (bruxism - grinding)

MATERIALS:

COMPOSITE RESIN (Tooth-colored):
- Pros: Aesthetic, bonds to tooth
- Cons: More technique-sensitive, may stain over time
- Use: Anterior (front) teeth, small-medium posterior (back)

AMALGAM (Silver):
- Pros: Strong, durable, cheaper
- Cons: Not aesthetic (dark), mercury (trace amounts, safe per ADA)
- Use: Large posterior restorations (molars)
- Declining use (aesthetic concerns, environmental)

PROCEDURE:
1. Local anesthesia (lidocaine 2% with epinephrine)
2. Isolate tooth (rubber dam or cotton rolls)
3. Remove decay (handpiece, bur)
4. Prep cavity (undercuts for retention)
5. Etch (acid gel, 15-20 sec, roughens enamel)
6. Bond (adhesive)
7. Place composite (layers, cure each with UV light 20 sec)
8. Shape, polish
9. Check bite (articulating paper, adjust high spots)

---

CROWN (Cap):

INDICATIONS:
- Large filling (>50% tooth structure)
- Root canal treated tooth (brittle, fracture risk)
- Fractured tooth
- Cosmetic

TYPES:
- Porcelain (ceramic): Aesthetic, strong (anterior/posterior)
- Porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM): Strong, metal substructure (posterior)
- Gold: Strong, conservative prep (posterior)
- Zirconia: Very strong, aesthetic (posterior)

PROCEDURE (2 visits):

VISIT 1 (Preparation):
1. Anesthesia
2. Reduce tooth (1.5-2mm, all surfaces)
3. Impression (putty, digital scan)
4. Temporary crown (acrylic, cemented with temp cement)
5. Send to lab (1-2 weeks)

VISIT 2 (Cementation):
1. Remove temporary
2. Try in crown (check fit, bite, shade)
3. Cement (permanent cement)
4. Clean excess cement
5. Check bite, polish

---

EXTRACTION:

INDICATIONS:
- Severe decay (unrestorable)
- Periodontal disease (severe mobility)
- Impacted wisdom teeth (pain, infection, cyst)
- Orthodontics (crowding)
- Fractured root

PROCEDURE:
1. Anesthesia (local, or IV sedation for surgical extraction)
2. Elevate (elevator loosens tooth)
3. Extract (forceps, gentle rocking motion)
4. Inspect socket (ensure all root fragments removed)
5. Gauze (bite 30-45 min, pressure stops bleeding)

POST-OP INSTRUCTIONS:
- Bite gauze 30-45 min
- No smoking, straw, spitting (dislodge clot, dry socket)
- Ice (20 min on, 20 off, first 24 hours)
- Soft foods (24-48 hours)
- Pain: Ibuprofen 600mg q6h + Tylenol 500mg (alternating)
- Rinse: Salt water (day 2, gentle, don't swish aggressively)
- Dry socket (3-4 days post-op, severe pain, bad taste):
  * Return to office, medicated dressing

---

ROOT CANAL (Endodontics):

INDICATIONS:
- Irreversible pulpitis (infection, abscess)
- Trauma (fractured tooth, exposed pulp)
- Deep decay reaching pulp

SYMPTOMS:
- Severe pain (throbbing, keeps awake at night)
- Sensitivity to hot (lingers after stimulus removed)
- Swelling, pus
- Tooth discoloration (gray, brown)

PROCEDURE (1-2 visits):
1. Anesthesia (may be difficult if severe infection, nerve already inflamed)
2. Rubber dam isolation
3. Access (drill through crown, expose pulp chamber)
4. Remove pulp (files, irrigate with sodium hypochlorite - bleach)
5. Shape canals (rotary files, hand files)
6. Fill canals (gutta-percha - rubber-like material)
7. Seal (temporary filling, then crown)

POST-OP:
- Tender 2-3 days (normal, inflammation)
- Ibuprofen for pain
- Crown within 2-4 weeks (tooth brittle, needs protection)

---

PERIODONTAL SURGERY:

GINGIVECTOMY (Remove excess gum tissue):
- Indications: Gingival hyperplasia (overgrowth, medications), cosmetic

FLAP SURGERY (Access deep pockets):
- Lift gum flap, scale root, place bone graft (if needed), suture

GINGIVAL GRAFT (Cover recession):
- Take tissue from palate, place over exposed root
- Reduce sensitivity, improve aesthetics

BONE GRAFT:
- Build bone (prepare for implant, or regenerate after periodontal disease)
- Autograft (own bone), allograft (cadaver), xenograft (animal), synthetic

## Preventive Dentistry

```markdown
PATIENT EDUCATION:

BRUSHING:
- Frequency: 2× daily (morning, before bed)
- Duration: 2 minutes
- Technique:
  * 45° angle to gumline
  * Small circular motions
  * Brush all surfaces (outer, inner, chewing)
- Toothbrush:
  * Soft bristles (medium/hard damage gums)
  * Replace every 3 months (or when bristles frayed)
  * Electric > manual (removes more plaque)

FLOSSING:
- Daily (removes plaque between teeth, where brush can't reach)
- Technique:
  * Wrap around tooth (C-shape)
  * Slide up and down (below gumline)
  * Use fresh section for each tooth
- Alternatives: Floss picks, water flosser (Waterpik)

FLUORIDE:
- Strengthens enamel (remineralization)
- Sources:
  * Toothpaste (1000-1500 ppm)
  * Mouthwash (0.05% sodium fluoride)
  * Professional treatment (5% sodium fluoride varnish, 1.23% APF gel)
- High caries risk: Prescription toothpaste (5000 ppm)

DIET:
- Limit sugar (bacteria feed on sugar, produce acid, decay)
- Frequency > amount (sipping soda all day worse than one can)
- Rinse after acidic foods (soda, citrus, wine)
- Xylitol (sugar substitute, reduces bacteria)

---

SEALANTS:

INDICATIONS:
- Deep pits/fissures (molars, premolars)
- Children (6-year molars, 12-year molars)
- High caries risk

PROCEDURE:
1. Clean tooth (pumice)
2. Etch (acid, 20 sec)
3. Apply sealant (resin)
4. Cure (UV light)
5. Check bite

EFFECTIVENESS: 80% reduction in caries (if intact)
DURATION: 5-10 years (check at each recall, repair if needed)

---

CARIES RISK ASSESSMENT:

LOW RISK:
- No new cavities 3+ years
- Good oral hygiene
- Regular fluoride exposure
- Low sugar diet

HIGH RISK:
- New cavities past year
- Poor oral hygiene
- Dry mouth (medications, radiation, Sjögren's syndrome)
- Frequent snacking, sugary drinks
- Deep pits/fissures
- Orthodontic appliances (brackets trap plaque)

MANAGEMENT (High risk):
- Fluoride varnish (3-6 month recalls)
- Chlorhexidine rinse (antibacterial)
- Xylitol gum
- Sealants
- Diet counseling

## Dental Emergencies

```markdown
TOOTHACHE:

CAUSES:
- Caries (cavity)
- Abscess (infection)
- Cracked tooth
- Food impaction
- Sensitive exposed root

TRIAGE:
- Mild: Ibuprofen, avoid hot/cold, schedule routine appointment
- Moderate-severe: Same day appointment
- Abscess (swelling, fever): Antibiotics (amoxicillin 500mg, 3× daily, 7 days), drainage, root canal or extraction

HOME CARE:
- Rinse warm salt water
- Floss (remove debris)
- Ibuprofen 600mg q6h (anti-inflammatory)
- Clove oil (eugenol, topical anesthetic)

---

KNOCKED-OUT TOOTH (Avulsion):

PERMANENT TOOTH (Time-sensitive! Best if replanted within 30 min):
1. Find tooth, handle by crown (not root)
2. Rinse gently (don't scrub, removes cells)
3. Replant if possible (bite gauze)
4. If can't replant: Store in milk, saline, or saliva (NOT water)
5. Go to dentist IMMEDIATELY

TREATMENT:
- Replant, splint (wire to adjacent teeth, 1-2 weeks)
- Root canal (within 7-10 days, prevents resorption)
- Prognosis: Good if <30 min, fair if 30-60 min, poor if >60 min

PRIMARY TOOTH (Baby tooth):
- DO NOT replant (risk damaging permanent tooth bud)

---

FRACTURED TOOTH:

ENAMEL ONLY: Smooth sharp edges, composite bonding (elective)

DENTIN EXPOSED: Cover with composite (sensitivity, protect pulp)

PULP EXPOSED: Root canal or extraction

ROOT FRACTURE: Splint (if horizontal), extract (if vertical)

---

BLEEDING (After extraction):

NORMAL: Oozing 24-48 hours (saliva mixed with blood, looks worse than is)

EXCESSIVE:
- Bite gauze (pressure, 30-45 min)
- Tea bag (tannic acid, promotes clotting)
- Avoid: Smoking, straw, spitting, rinsing aggressively
- If continues: Return to office (may need suture or hemostatic agent)
```

## Practice Management

```markdown
TREATMENT PLANNING:

CASE PRESENTATION:
1. Diagnosis (what's wrong)
2. Options (treatment options, pros/cons)
3. Recommendation (your professional opinion)
4. Cost (fees, insurance coverage)
5. Consent (risks, benefits, alternatives)

EXAMPLE:
> "You have a large cavity on tooth #19. We have three options:
> 1. Filling ($200) - If decay hasn't reached nerve
> 2. Crown ($1200) - If large amount of tooth missing
> 3. Root canal + Crown ($2200) - If nerve is infected
> I recommend the crown, as the cavity is quite large. Your insurance covers 50%, so your out-of-pocket would be $600. Without treatment, the tooth will likely abscess and require extraction. Do you have any questions?"

---

SCHEDULING:

PRODUCTION GOALS:
- Daily goal (e.g., $5,000/day for solo practice)
- Block schedule (match procedure to time slot)
  * Hygiene: 60 min (prophy) or 90 min (new patient)
  * Crown prep: 60-90 min
  * Root canal: 90-120 min
  * Fillings: 30-60 min (depending on complexity)

SAME-DAY EMERGENCIES:
- Reserve 1-2 slots daily (walk-ins, emergencies)
- If not filled, use for admin, CE (continuing education)

---

INSURANCE:

FEE-FOR-SERVICE:
- Patient pays full fee
- Highest profit margin
- Limited by insurance reimbursement rates

PPO (Preferred Provider Organization):
- Contracted fees (discounted, e.g., 20-30% off)
- More patients (in-network)
- Lower profit per procedure

HMO/DHMO (Dental Health Maintenance Organization):
- Capitation (fixed monthly fee per patient, regardless of services)
- Low reimbursement
- Many procedures require pre-authorization
- Generally avoided by private practices

BILLING:
- Submit claims electronically (faster reimbursement)
- Follow up on unpaid claims (30-60-90 days)
- Collect patient portion (co-pay, deductible) at visit

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Prevention** - Most dental disease is preventable (fluoride, hygiene, diet counseling)
2. **Early intervention** - Small cavity → filling ($200), neglected → root canal + crown ($2200)
3. **Patient education** - Informed patients make better decisions (case presentation)
4. **Evidence-based** - Follow clinical guidelines (ADA, AAE, AAPD)
5. **Manage anxiety** - Dental fear common (empathy, gentle technique, sedation options)
