HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
- Onset: When did it start? Sudden or gradual?
- Location: Where exactly? (Point to area)
- Duration: Constant or intermittent?
- Intensity: 0-10 pain scale
- Aggravating factors: What makes it worse?
- Relieving factors: What helps?

---

OBJECTIVE (Physical Examination):

OBSERVATION:
- Posture (standing, sitting)
- Gait (walking pattern)

Example (Shoulder flexion):
- Normal: 0-180°
- Patient: 0-120° (limited by pain)

STRENGTH TESTING (Manual Muscle Test 0-5):
0 - No contraction
1 - Flicker of contraction
2 - Movement with gravity eliminated
3 - Movement against gravity
4 - Movement against some resistance
5 - Normal strength

SPECIAL TESTS:
- Orthopedic tests for specific conditions
- Example: Neer's test (shoulder impingement)

PALPATION:
- Feel for tenderness, muscle spasm, temperature

---

ASSESSMENT:
Clinical impression based on findings

PLAN:
Treatment interventions & frequency
```

## Common Conditions

### Low Back Pain

```markdown
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:

MECHANICAL (Most common, 90%):
- Muscle strain
- Disc herniation
- Facet joint dysfunction
- Degenerative disc disease

RED FLAGS (Refer to MD):
🚩 Bowel/bladder dysfunction (cauda equina)
🚩 Progressive neurological deficit
🚩 Saddle anesthesia (numbness in groin)
🚩 Fever, night sweats (infection)
🚩 History of cancer (metastasis)
🚩 Age >50 with new back pain (cancer, fracture)
🚩 Recent trauma (fracture)

---

ASSESSMENT TESTS:

STRAIGHT LEG RAISE (SLR):
- Patient supine, leg straight
- Therapist lifts leg
- Positive: Pain <70° (nerve root irritation)
- Reproduction of leg pain (not back pain)

SLUMP TEST:
- Patient sits, slumps forward
- Add neck flexion, extend knee
- Positive: Leg pain (neural tension)

---

TREATMENT:

ACUTE PHASE (0-2 weeks):
- Pain relief: Ice, TENS, gentle manual therapy
- Education: Avoid aggravating movements
- Activity modification: No prolonged sitting/bending
- Gentle ROM exercises

SUBACUTE PHASE (2-6 weeks):
- Core strengthening:
  * Bird dog
  * Dead bug
  * Plank (progress from knees to toes)
- Hip strengthening (glute bridges)
- McKenzie extension exercises (if centralizes pain)

CHRONIC PHASE (6+ weeks):
- Progressive loading:
  * Squats
  * Deadlifts (proper form!)
  * Carries (farmer's walk)
- Return to activity/sport
- Maintenance program

---

HOME EXERCISE PROGRAM:

CAT-COW (Lumbar mobility):
- Start on hands and knees
- Arch back (cow), then round back (cat)
- 10 reps, 2x daily

BIRD DOG (Core stability):
- On hands and knees
- Extend opposite arm and leg
- Hold 5 seconds, 10 reps each side

DEAD BUG (Core anti-extension):
- Lie on back, knees bent 90°
- Lower opposite arm and leg
- Keep back flat on floor
- 10 reps each side

GLUTE BRIDGE (Hip extension):
- Lie on back, knees bent
- Lift hips, squeeze glutes
- Hold 2 seconds, 15 reps
```

---

### Shoulder Pain

```markdown
COMMON DIAGNOSES:

ROTATOR CUFF TENDINOPATHY:
- Pain with overhead activities
- Weakness with arm elevation
- Special tests: Neer's, Hawkins-Kennedy

FROZEN SHOULDER (Adhesive capsulitis):
- Severe ROM limitation (passive AND active)
- External rotation most limited
- 3 phases: Freezing (painful), Frozen (stiff), Thawing (improving)

SHOULDER IMPINGEMENT:
- Pain with overhead reaching
- Painful arc (60-120° abduction)
- Positive Neer's test

---

TREATMENT:

ROTATOR CUFF REHAB:

Phase 1 (Pain reduction):
- Pendulum exercises
- Passive ROM
- Scapular setting

Phase 2 (Strengthening):
- External rotation (band/cable):
  * Elbow at side, 90° bent
  * Rotate arm outward
  * 15 reps × 3 sets

- Internal rotation:
  * Same position, rotate inward

- Scaption (scapular plane elevation):
  * Arms at 30° forward from body
  * Thumbs up, lift to shoulder height
  * 10 reps × 3 sets

Phase 3 (Return to function):
- Plyometrics (ball throws)
- Sport-specific training
- Overhead press progression

---

FROZEN SHOULDER:

TREATMENT (18-month course!):
- Patient education (set expectations)
- Grade 3-4 mobilizations (aggressive stretching)
- Capsular stretching:
  * Sleeper stretch (internal rotation)
  * Cross-body stretch
  * Overhead stretch
- Home stretching 5x daily (commitment!)
- Consider cortisone injection (early phase)
```

### Knee Pain

```markdown
PATELLOFEMORAL PAIN SYNDROME (Runner's Knee):

SYMPTOMS:
- Anterior knee pain
- Worse with stairs, squatting, prolonged sitting
- No swelling

CAUSES:
- Weak glutes (hip abductors)
- Tight IT band, quads
- Poor foot mechanics (overpronation)

TREATMENT:

STRENGTHENING:
- Clamshells (glute medius):
  * Side-lying, knees bent
  * Lift top knee, keep feet together
  * 20 reps × 3 sets

- Single-leg squats:
  * Stand on affected leg
  * Squat to 45°, control knee alignment
  * 10 reps × 3 sets

- Step-downs:
  * Stand on step
  * Lower opposite foot slowly
  * 10 reps × 3 sets

STRETCHING:
- IT band foam roll (painful but effective!)
- Quad stretch
- Hip flexor stretch

TAPING:
- McConnell taping (medial glide)
- Reduces pain immediately (feedback for exercises)

---

ACL RECONSTRUCTION REHAB:

POST-OP TIMELINE:

WEEK 0-2:
- Cryotherapy (ice, reduce swelling)
- Quad sets (isometric contractions)
- Straight leg raises
- Ankle pumps
- ROM: 0-90° (full extension priority!)

WEEK 2-6:
- ROM: Full (0-130°)
- Stationary bike
- Partial squats (0-60°)
- Balance exercises

WEEK 6-12:
- Jogging (straight line)
- Leg press
- Lunges
- Hop training (double-leg)

MONTH 4-6:
- Agility drills (cutting, pivoting)
- Single-leg hop tests (90% of uninjured leg)
- Sport-specific drills

MONTH 6-9:
- Return to sport (if passing tests)
- Criteria:
  * ROM equal to opposite side
  * Strength 90% of opposite
  * Functional tests passed
  * Psychological readiness

DON'T RUSH! Most re-tears occur in first year

## Manual Therapy Techniques

```markdown
SOFT TISSUE MOBILIZATION:

MYOFASCIAL RELEASE:
- Sustained pressure on tight muscles/fascia
- Hold 30-90 seconds
- Patient breathes deeply
- Example: Suboccipital release (neck tension)

TRIGGER POINT THERAPY:
- Identify trigger points (taut bands, referred pain)
- Apply ischemic compression
- Hold until pain decreases (30-60 sec)
- Common sites: Upper trap, levator scap, piriformis

INSTRUMENT-ASSISTED (IASTM):
- Graston, Hawk Grips tools
- Break down scar tissue, adhesions
- Followed by stretching

---

JOINT MOBILIZATION (Maitland Grades):

GRADE 1 & 2 (Pain relief):
- Small amplitude movements
- Within available range
- Stimulate mechanoreceptors (gate control theory)

GRADE 3 & 4 (Increase ROM):
- Large amplitude movements
- Into tissue resistance
- Stretches capsule

Example (Glenohumeral joint):
- Patient supine, arm in scaption
- Therapist stabilizes scapula
- Mobilize humerus (posterior glide)
- Improves flexion ROM

---

CONTRAINDICATIONS:

ABSOLUTE:
- Fracture
- Infection
- Malignancy
- Acute inflammation
- Hypermobility

RELATIVE:
- Osteoporosis (use caution, low grade)
- Pregnancy (avoid certain positions)
- Anticoagulants (avoid aggressive techniques)
```

---

## Exercise Prescription

```markdown
FITT PRINCIPLE:

FREQUENCY: How often?
- Strength: 2-3x/week (48-hour recovery)
- Flexibility: Daily
- Cardio: 3-5x/week

INTENSITY: How hard?
- Strength: 60-80% 1RM (10-15 reps)
- Cardio: 65-85% max HR (moderate to vigorous)

TIME: How long?
- Strength: 30-45 min
- Cardio: 30-60 min
- Stretching: Hold 30 seconds

TYPE: What kind?
- Strength: Resistance bands, weights, bodyweight
- Cardio: Walk, bike, swim
- Flexibility: Static, dynamic stretching

---

PROGRESSION:

BEGINNER → INTERMEDIATE → ADVANCED

Example (Squats):
1. Wall sit (isometric) → 30 sec hold
2. Sit-to-stand (from chair) → 15 reps
3. Bodyweight squat → 20 reps
4. Goblet squat (dumbbell) → 12 reps
5. Barbell back squat → 8 reps

PROGRESS WHEN:
- 2 consecutive sessions with good form
- No increase in pain
- RPE <6/10 (rating of perceived exertion)

---

COMPLIANCE STRATEGIES:

BARRIERS:
- "Too busy" → Shorter workouts (15 min)
- "Too painful" → Modify exercises
- "Don't understand" → Video demonstrations
- "Forgot" → Set phone reminders

MOTIVATORS:
- Visible progress (track ROM, strength)
- Functional goals (not just pain relief)
- Accountability (follow-up appointments)
- Social support (group classes)

SUCCESS RATE:
- 50-70% adherence to HEP (home exercise program)
- Ways to improve:
  * Fewer exercises (3-5 max)
  * Clear instructions (written + video)
  * Progress tracking (patient logs)
  * Regular check-ins

## Key Takeaways

1. **Movement is medicine** - Active rehab > passive modalities
2. **Load management** - Progressive overload, avoid too much too soon
3. **Patient education** - Empowerment, self-management
4. **Functional goals** - Meaningful to patient's life
5. **Home exercise compliance** - Keep it simple, 3-5 exercises max
