## Common Conditions

### Dental Caries (Cavities)

```markdown
CLASSIFICATION (G.V. Black):

CLASS I: Pits & fissures (occlusal surface)
- Location: Molars, premolars
- Treatment: Composite or amalgam filling

CLASS II: Between posterior teeth (interproximal)
- Location: Molars, premolars
- Treatment: MOD filling or onlay

CLASS III: Between anterior teeth
- Location: Incisors, canines
- Treatment: Composite filling (tooth-colored)

CLASS IV: Incisal edge + interproximal
- Location: Front teeth
- Treatment: Composite, may need crown

CLASS V: Gumline (cervical)
- Location: Any tooth
- Cause: Recession, abrasion, erosion
- Treatment: Composite filling

CLASS VI: Incisal edge wear
- Location: Front teeth
- Treatment: Bonding or veneer

---

DIAGNOSIS:

VISUAL INSPECTION:
- White spots (early demineralization)
- Brown/black lesions (active caries)
- Stickiness when probing

RADIOGRAPHS:
- Radiolucent (dark) areas in enamel/dentin
- Interproximal caries missed on visual

LASER CAVITY DETECTION (DIAGNOdent):
- Quantifies demineralization
- Numbers: 0-13 (healthy), 14-20 (monitor), 21+ (treat)

---

TREATMENT DECISION:

EARLY CARIES (enamel only):
✅ Remineralization (fluoride varnish, MI Paste)
✅ Monitor every 6 months
❌ Don't drill yet!

MODERATE CARIES (dentin):
✅ Composite or amalgam restoration
✅ Remove decay, restore form & function

DEEP CARIES (near pulp):
✅ Indirect pulp cap (protective liner)
✅ Monitor for symptoms (pain, sensitivity)
⚠️ May need RCT if symptoms develop

PULPAL INVOLVEMENT:
✅ Root canal treatment + crown
❌ Filling won't work (tooth will abscess)
```

## Restorative Procedures

### Composite Filling

```markdown
INDICATION:
- Small to moderate cavity
- Esthetic areas (front teeth)
- Conservative preparation

STEPS:

1. ANESTHESIA:
   - Lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for full numbness
   - Test: No response to cold or probing

2. ISOLATION:
   - Rubber dam (ideal) or cotton rolls
   - Keeps area dry (moisture = failure)

3. CARIES REMOVAL:
   - High-speed handpiece with carbide bur
   - Remove all decay (brown, soft dentin)
   - Preserve healthy tooth structure

4. ETCH:
   - 37% phosphoric acid gel
   - Enamel: 15-30 seconds
   - Dentin: 15 seconds
   - Rinse thoroughly, air dry

5. BONDING AGENT:
   - Apply adhesive (Single Bond, OptiBond)
   - Thin layer, air dry
   - Light cure 10-20 seconds

6. COMPOSITE PLACEMENT:
   - Layer 2mm increments (prevents shrinkage)
   - Sculpt anatomy (cusps, grooves)
   - Light cure each layer 20 seconds

7. FINISHING & POLISHING:
   - Fine diamond bur (shape contours)
   - Polishing discs (smooth surface)
   - Check occlusion (bite): Remove high spots
   - Floss: Should pass through contacts

POST-OP INSTRUCTIONS:
- Avoid chewing 1 hour (anesthesia)
- Sensitivity normal for 1-2 weeks
- Call if pain increases or persists

---

MATERIALS:

COMPOSITE RESIN:
- Pros: Tooth-colored, bonds to tooth, conservative
- Cons: Technique-sensitive, can shrink, may stain
- Lifespan: 5-10 years

AMALGAM (Silver filling):
- Pros: Strong, durable, easy to place
- Cons: Not esthetic (silver color), requires more removal
- Lifespan: 10-15 years
- Declining use due to esthetics & mercury concerns

GLASS IONOMER:
- Pros: Releases fluoride, bonds chemically
- Cons: Weaker than composite, rough surface
- Use: Temporary filling, pediatric, root surface
```

### Crown Preparation

```markdown
INDICATIONS:
- Large filling (>50% of tooth)
- Root canal treated tooth (prevents fracture)
- Cracked tooth
- Esthetics (cosmetic improvement)

TYPES:

FULL COVERAGE CROWN:
- Covers entire tooth
- Materials: Porcelain, zirconia, PFM (porcelain-fused-to-metal), gold

ONLAY (3/4 crown):
- Partial coverage (doesn't cover full tooth)
- More conservative than full crown

---

PROCEDURE (2 visits):

VISIT 1 - PREPARATION:

1. ANESTHESIA & ISOLATION

2. TOOTH PREPARATION:
   - Remove 1.5-2mm tooth structure (all surfaces)
   - Create smooth, tapered walls (6° taper)
   - Finish line: Chamfer or shoulder
   - Avoid undercuts

3. IMPRESSION:
   - Traditional: Polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) material
   - Digital: Intraoral scanner (iTero, CEREC)
   - Capture prep, opposing arch, bite

4. TEMPORARY CROWN:
   - Acrylic or bis-acrylic material
   - Protects tooth, maintains space
   - Cement with temp cement (easy removal)

5. SHADE SELECTION:
   - Match adjacent teeth
   - Vita shade guide
   - Take photo for lab

VISIT 2 - CEMENTATION (2-3 weeks later):

1. REMOVE TEMPORARY:
   - Gentle pressure (temp cement weak)
   - Clean tooth thoroughly

2. TRY-IN CROWN:
   - Check fit (margins, contacts)
   - Check occlusion (bite)
   - Check esthetics (shade, contour)
   - Adjust if needed

3. CEMENTATION:
   - Etch & bond (if all-ceramic)
   - Resin cement (strong, esthetic)
   - Remove excess cement
   - Light cure

4. FINAL CHECK:
   - Occlusion (should feel like natural tooth)
   - Floss (should pass but be tight)

POST-OP:
- Sensitivity normal for 1-2 weeks
- Avoid sticky foods for 24 hours
- Crown should last 10-15 years

## Endodontics (Root Canal)

```markdown
INDICATIONS:
- Irreversible pulpitis (severe toothache)
- Necrotic pulp (dead tooth)
- Periapical abscess (infection at root tip)

DIAGNOSIS:

SYMPTOMS:
- Spontaneous pain (no stimulus)
- Lingering pain to cold (>10 seconds)
- Pain to biting
- Swelling, pus drainage

TESTS:
- Cold test: No response (necrotic) or prolonged pain (pulpitis)
- Electric pulp test (EPT): Measures nerve vitality
- Percussion: Pain = periapical involvement
- Radiograph: Radiolucency at apex (infection)

---

PROCEDURE:

1. ANESTHESIA:
   - May need more anesthetic (inflamed nerve harder to numb)
   - Intraligamentary injection if not numb

2. ACCESS OPENING:
   - Remove roof of pulp chamber
   - Locate all canals (molars have 3-4)

3. CLEANING & SHAPING:
   - Remove infected pulp tissue
   - Rotary files (NiTi) shape canals
   - Irrigate: Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) kills bacteria

4. OBTURATION (Filling):
   - Gutta-percha (rubber-like material)
   - Sealer cement
   - Fill from apex to crown

5. RESTORATION:
   - Core buildup (if much tooth loss)
   - Crown (recommended for posterior teeth)

NUMBER OF VISITS:
- Single visit: If no active infection
- Two visits: If abscess present (drain, medicate, fill later)

---

SUCCESS RATE:
- 85-97% (depends on case complexity)
- Retreatment if initial fails: 50-75%

ALTERNATIVE:
- Extraction + implant or bridge
```

## Periodontics (Gum Disease)

```markdown
STAGES:

GINGIVITIS (Reversible):
- Inflammation of gums
- Bleeding, redness, swelling
- No bone loss
- Treatment: Professional cleaning + improved oral hygiene

PERIODONTITIS (Irreversible):
- Destruction of bone & ligament
- Pocket depth 4-5mm (mild), 6-7mm (moderate), 8+mm (severe)
- Tooth mobility, recession
- Treatment: Scaling & root planing, surgery if severe

---

SCALING & ROOT PLANING (Deep Cleaning):

INDICATION:
- Pocket depth ≥4mm
- Subgingival calculus (tartar below gumline)

PROCEDURE:
- Anesthesia (local)
- Ultrasonic scaler (remove calculus)
- Hand scalers (curets) smooth root surface
- Usually done in quadrants (2-4 visits)

POST-OP:
- Sensitivity for 1-2 weeks
- Soft diet for 24 hours
- Chlorhexidine rinse (antibacterial)

MAINTENANCE:
- 3-month recalls (more frequent than 6-month)
- Re-evaluate pocket depths (should reduce to 3mm)

---

SURGICAL OPTIONS (Advanced cases):

FLAP SURGERY:
- Lift gums, clean deeper areas
- Reduce pocket depth
- Better access for bone grafting

BONE GRAFT:
- Add synthetic or donor bone
- Stimulates regeneration
- Improves tooth stability

GINGIVAL GRAFT:
- Cover exposed roots (recession)
- Donor tissue from palate or allograft
- Reduces sensitivity, improves esthetics

## Dental Implants

```markdown
IMPLANT ANATOMY:

FIXTURE (Implant body):
- Titanium screw into jawbone
- Osseointegration (bone grows around implant)
- 3-6 months healing

ABUTMENT:
- Connector piece
- Screws into implant

CROWN:
- Ceramic restoration
- Screwed or cemented onto abutment

---

TREATMENT PLANNING:

REQUIREMENTS:
✅ Adequate bone (height & width)
✅ Healthy gums (no active periodontitis)
✅ Good oral hygiene
✅ Non-smoker (or willing to quit)
❌ Uncontrolled diabetes (poor healing)
❌ Bisphosphonate use (osteonecrosis risk)

IMAGING:
- CBCT (Cone Beam CT): 3D image
- Measure bone dimensions
- Identify anatomical structures (sinus, nerve)

---

SURGICAL PROTOCOL:

STAGE 1 - IMPLANT PLACEMENT:
1. Anesthesia (local)
2. Incision, reflect gum flap
3. Drill pilot hole (precise depth & width)
4. Place implant fixture
5. Cover with healing cap or gum tissue
6. Suture

Healing: 3-6 months (osseointegration)

STAGE 2 - ABUTMENT PLACEMENT:
1. Uncover implant (if buried)
2. Remove healing cap
3. Attach abutment
4. Gum healing: 2-4 weeks

STAGE 3 - CROWN PLACEMENT:
1. Impression (custom abutment or crown)
2. Try-in, adjust
3. Final cementation or screw retention

---

SUCCESS RATE:
- 95-98% (lower jaw)
- 90-95% (upper jaw - softer bone)

MAINTENANCE:
- Daily brushing & flossing
- 3-6 month recalls
- Monitor for peri-implantitis (infection around implant)
- Lifespan: 10-20+ years
```
