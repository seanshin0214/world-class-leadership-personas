---

PRESCRIPTION PROCESSING:

1. RECEIVE & VERIFY:
   - Check prescription validity (elements, authenticity)
   - Insurance verification (coverage, prior authorization needed?)

2. DRUG UTILIZATION REVIEW (DUR):
   - Allergies (patient profile check)
   - Drug-drug interactions (check all current medications)
   - Drug-disease interactions (e.g., NSAIDs + heart failure)
   - Duplicate therapy (same drug class from different prescribers)
   - Therapeutic duplication (2 statins, 2 SSRIs)
   - Appropriate dose, frequency, duration

3. PREPARE MEDICATION:
   - Count/pour (tablets, capsules)
   - Label (patient name, drug, directions, warnings)
   - Auxiliary labels:
     * "Take with food"
     * "May cause drowsiness"
     * "Avoid alcohol"
     * "Shake well"
     * "Refrigerate"

4. FINAL VERIFICATION (Pharmacist check):
   - Right drug, strength, quantity
   - Right patient, directions

5. PATIENT COUNSELING (Offer for new Rx, required by law):
   - Drug name, purpose
   - Directions (how to take, with/without food, time of day)
   - Duration (how long to take)
   - Side effects (common, when to call doctor)
   - Storage (room temp, refrigerate, protect from light)
   - Refills (when to expect next refill)

DOSAGE CALCULATIONS:

EXAMPLE 1 (Liquid):
Prescription: Amoxicillin 250mg PO TID × 10 days
Available: 125mg/5mL suspension
Dose: 250mg ÷ 125mg/5mL = 10mL per dose
Frequency: 3× daily
Duration: 10 days
Total volume: 10mL × 3 × 10 = 300mL

EXAMPLE 2 (Tablets):
Prescription: Levothyroxine 75mcg PO daily
Available: 50mcg and 25mcg tablets
Dispense: 50mcg + 25mcg = 75mcg (instruct: take 1 of each daily)
Or: Dispense 50mcg, instruct: take 1.5 tablets daily (less ideal, harder to split)

EXAMPLE 3 (Weight-based):
Prescription: Acetaminophen 10mg/kg PO Q6H PRN fever
Patient weight: 20 kg
Dose: 10mg/kg × 20kg = 200mg
Available: 160mg/5mL suspension
Volume: 200mg ÷ 160mg/5mL = 6.25mL

---

## Drug Interactions

```markdown
PHARMACOKINETIC INTERACTIONS (How body processes drug):

ABSORPTION:
- Calcium, iron, magnesium bind antibiotics (tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones)
  * Action: Separate by 2-4 hours

DISTRIBUTION:
- Warfarin highly protein-bound (displaced by NSAIDs, increases bleeding)
  * Action: Monitor INR closely

METABOLISM (CYP450 enzymes):
- CYP3A4 inhibitors (grapefruit juice, azole antifungals, macrolides)
  * Increase levels of: Statins, Ca-channel blockers, immunosuppressants
  * Risk: Toxicity (rhabdomyolysis from statins)
- CYP3A4 inducers (rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine)
  * Decrease levels of: Oral contraceptives, warfarin
  * Risk: Treatment failure (pregnancy, clots)

EXCRETION:
- NSAIDs decrease kidney function → lithium accumulation
  * Action: Monitor lithium levels

---

PHARMACODYNAMIC INTERACTIONS (Drug effects):

ADDITIVE EFFECTS:
- Multiple CNS depressants (opioids + benzodiazepines + alcohol)
  * Risk: Respiratory depression, death
  * Action: Avoid combination, counsel patient

ANTAGONISTIC EFFECTS:
- Beta-blockers + beta-agonists (albuterol for asthma)
  * Beta-blocker blocks albuterol's effect
  * Action: Use cardioselective beta-blocker (metoprolol, not propranolol)

---

COMMON HIGH-RISK INTERACTIONS:

WARFARIN + NSAIDs:
- Increased bleeding risk (GI bleed)
- Action: Use acetaminophen instead (safer for pain)

WARFARIN + ANTIBIOTICS:
- Many antibiotics increase warfarin effect
- Action: Monitor INR weekly during antibiotic course

ACE INHIBITORS + POTASSIUM:
- Hyperkalemia (elevated potassium, cardiac arrhythmia)
- Action: Avoid K+ supplements, salt substitutes (KCl)

SSRI + TRAMADOL/TRIPTANS:
- Serotonin syndrome (agitation, tremor, hyperthermia, can be fatal)
- Action: Avoid combination, use alternative analgesic

STATINS + GEMFIBROZIL:
- Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown, kidney failure)
- Action: Use fenofibrate instead (safer with statins)

DIGOXIN + AMIODARONE:
- Digoxin toxicity (amiodarone inhibits elimination)
- Action: Decrease digoxin dose by 50%

MEDICATION THERAPY MANAGEMENT (MTM):

ELIGIBILITY (Medicare Part D):
- Multiple chronic conditions (3+)
- Multiple medications (8+)
- High drug costs ($5,000+ annually)

PROCESS:
1. COMPREHENSIVE MEDICATION REVIEW (CMR):
   - Review all medications (prescription, OTC, supplements)
   - Identify: Drug interactions, duplications, non-adherence, gaps in therapy
   - Create Personal Medication List (PML)
   - Action plan (what to start, stop, change)

2. TARGETED MEDICATION REVIEW (TMR):
   - Specific issue (e.g., new diagnosis, medication change)

OUTCOMES:
- Improve adherence (simplify regimen, address cost)
- Reduce adverse events (interactions, side effects)
- Optimize therapy (meet treatment goals)

EXAMPLE:
- Patient: 75yo female, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia
- Medications: Metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, aspirin, vitamin D
- Findings: A1C 8.5% (goal <7%), BP 145/90 (goal <130/80)
- Recommendations:
  * Increase metformin dose (improve diabetes control)
  * Add amlodipine (BP control)
  * Continue statin, aspirin (cardiovascular protection)
  * Follow up: 3 months

---

POINT-OF-CARE TESTING:

SERVICES (In-pharmacy):
- Blood pressure
- Blood glucose (diabetes screening)
- A1C (diabetes monitoring)
