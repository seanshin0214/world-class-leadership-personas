## Evidence-Based Treatments

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

```markdown
COGNITIVE MODEL:

Event → Thought → Emotion → Behavior

EXAMPLE:
Event: Friend doesn't text back
Thought: "They hate me"
Emotion: Sad, anxious
Behavior: Isolate, ruminate

INTERVENTION: Challenge thought
Rational thought: "Maybe they're busy"
New emotion: Less anxious
New behavior: Text someone else

---

COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS:

ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING:
"I got a B, I'm a total failure"
Challenge: "One B doesn't define me"

OVERGENERALIZATION:
"I failed once, I always fail"
Challenge: "I've succeeded many times"

MENTAL FILTER:
Focus on negative, ignore positive
Challenge: "What went well today?"

CATASTROPHIZING:
"I'll get fired, lose house, end up homeless"
Challenge: "What's realistically likely?"

MIND READING:
"They think I'm stupid"
Challenge: "What evidence do I have?"

PERSONALIZATION:
"The meeting was bad, it's my fault"
Challenge: "What else contributed?"

SHOULD STATEMENTS:
"I should be perfect"
Challenge: "Says who? Is this helpful?"

---

CBT TECHNIQUES:

THOUGHT RECORD:
| Situation | Automatic Thought | Emotion | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Balanced Thought | New Emotion |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|--------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Boss frowned | He hates me | Anxious (80%) | He looked upset | He later thanked me for report | Maybe he's stressed | Anxious (30%) |

BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION:
- Schedule pleasant activities
- Track mood (often improves with activity)
- Example: Walk 20 min daily, call friend 2×/week

EXPOSURE HIERARCHY (For anxiety):
1. Look at picture of spider (Anxiety: 20/100)
2. Watch video of spider (40/100)
3. Spider in jar across room (60/100)
4. Spider in jar, hold jar (80/100)
5. Spider on hand (100/100)

Start with #1, practice until anxiety drops 50%
Then move to #2, etc.

BEHAVIORAL EXPERIMENTS:
Belief: "If I speak in class, I'll embarrass myself"
Experiment: Speak once, observe what happens
Result: No one laughed, felt proud
New belief: "I can speak up"

---

PROTOCOL:

SESSION 1-2: Assessment, psychoeducation
SESSION 3-4: Identify thought patterns
SESSION 5-10: Challenge thoughts, behavioral experiments
SESSION 11-12: Relapse prevention, maintenance

HOMEWORK:
- Essential to CBT
- Practice techniques daily
- Review in next session
```

### Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT)

```markdown
SIX CORE PROCESSES:

ACCEPTANCE:
- Make room for uncomfortable feelings
- "I notice anxiety is present"
- vs suppression ("Don't think about it!")

COGNITIVE DEFUSION:
- Thoughts are just thoughts (not facts)
- "I'm having the thought that I'm worthless"
- vs fusion ("I AM worthless")

PRESENT MOMENT:
- Mindfulness
- Focus on here and now
- vs rumination (past) or worry (future)

SELF-AS-CONTEXT:
- Observer perspective
- "I am the sky, thoughts are clouds passing"
- vs attachment to self-stories

VALUES:
- What matters to you?
- Relationships, career, health, creativity
- NOT goals (ongoing direction)

COMMITTED ACTION:
- Take action aligned with values
- Even in presence of discomfort
- Small steps

---

TECHNIQUES:

LEAVES ON A STREAM:
- Imagine stream, leaves floating by
- Place each thought on a leaf
- Watch it float away
- Observe without attaching

PASSENGERS ON THE BUS:
- You're driving bus (life)
- Anxious thoughts are passengers
- They're loud, demanding
- But you still choose direction

VALUES CLARIFICATION:
"Imagine your 80th birthday. What do you want people to say about you?"
- Helps identify what truly matters
- Guides behavioral choices

COMMITTED ACTION:
Value: Connection with family
Action: Call mom 1×/week (even when busy/anxious)
Result: Meaningful life, aligned with values
```

### Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)

```markdown

- GIVE (maintain relationship):
  * Gentle, Interested, Validate, Easy manner
- FAST (self-respect):
