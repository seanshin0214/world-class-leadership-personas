APPROACH:

DISTANCE EXAM (Before touching):
- Observe: Mentation (alert, depressed, obtunded), posture, gait, respiratory effort
- Body condition score (BCS 1-9):
  * 1-3: Thin (ribs visible, no fat)
  * 4-5: Ideal (ribs palpable, visible waist)
  * 6-9: Overweight/obese (ribs difficult to feel, no waist)

SYSTEMATIC EXAM (Head to tail):

HEAD:
- Eyes:
  * Pupil size, symmetry (anisocoria = unequal, neurologic issue)
  * Sclera (red = inflammation, yellow = jaundice/liver)
  * Discharge (clear = allergy, green/yellow = infection)
- Ears:
  * Odor (yeasty = yeast infection, foul = bacteria)
  * Discharge, debris
  * Ear canal (red = otitis externa)
- Mouth:
  * Mucous membranes: Pink (normal), pale (anemia), brick red (shock, toxin), blue (cyanosis, hypoxia)
  * CRT (capillary refill time): Press gum, release, <2 seconds normal, >2 sec = poor perfusion
  * Dental disease: Tartar, gingivitis, fractured teeth
- Nose: Discharge, airflow (bilateral vs unilateral)

NECK:
- Lymph nodes: Palpate (submandibular, prescapular) - enlarged = infection, cancer
- Trachea: Palpate, cough reflex (collapsing trachea common in small breeds)

THORAX:
- AUSCULTATION (Stethoscope):
  * Heart rate (HR):
    - Dog: 60-140 BPM (larger = slower, smaller = faster)
    - Cat: 120-180 BPM
  * Heart rhythm: Regular (normal), irregular (arrhythmia, murmur)
  * Heart murmur: Grade I-VI (I = faint, VI = loud, palpable thrill)
    - Common causes: Mitral valve disease (dogs), HCM (cats)
  * Lung sounds:
    - Clear (normal)
    - Crackles (fluid, pneumonia, pulmonary edema)
    - Wheezes (airway constriction, asthma in cats)
    - Muffled (pleural effusion, pneumothorax)
- Respiratory rate (RR):
  * Dog: 10-30 breaths/min (resting)
  * Cat: 20-30 breaths/min
  * Dyspnea (difficulty breathing): Open-mouth breathing, orthopnea (can't lie down)

ABDOMEN:
- Palpation:
  * Tense/painful (peritonitis, foreign body, pancreatitis)
  * Fluid wave (ascites)
  * Masses (spleen, liver, bladder, intestines)
  * Kidneys (cats: palpate easily, dogs: harder)

LIMBS:
- Range of motion (ROM): Check each joint
- Palpation: Pain, swelling, crepitus (grinding)
- Lameness: Weight-bearing vs non-weight-bearing
  * Non-weight-bearing: Fracture, cruciate ligament tear, severe pain

SKIN:
- Lesions: Primary (pustules, papules, wheals) vs secondary (crusts, scales, erosions)
- Parasites: Fleas (black dots = flea dirt), ticks
- Alopecia (hair loss): Pattern (symmetrical = hormonal, patchy = infection/allergy)

VITAL SIGNS:

TEMPERATURE:
- Dog: 100-102.5°F (37.8-39.2°C)
- Cat: 100-102.5°F
- Hyperthermia: >103°F (heat stroke, infection)
- Hypothermia: <99°F (shock, anesthesia)

PULSE:
- Femoral artery (inner thigh)
- Quality: Strong (normal), weak (shock, dehydration), bounding (hyperthyroidism)

HYDRATION:
- Skin tent: Lift skin, should snap back immediately
  * Delayed (2-3 sec) = 5-7% dehydrated
  * Stands up (3+ sec) = >8% dehydrated
- Tacky gums (dry = dehydrated)
- Sunken eyes

## Surgery

```markdown
PRE-ANESTHETIC WORKUP:

PHYSICAL EXAM:
- Cardiovascular, respiratory (ensure stable for anesthesia)

BLOODWORK:
- Pre-op profile: CBC, chemistry (liver, kidney function)
- Age: <5 years (optional), 5-7 years (recommended), >7 years (required)
- Abnormalities:
  * Anemia → delay, investigate
  * Elevated liver enzymes → adjust anesthetic protocol
  * Elevated kidney values → IV fluids critical

---

ANESTHESIA PROTOCOL:

PREMEDICATION:
- Sedative: Dexmedetomidine (Dexdomitor), acepromazine
- Opioid: Hydromorphone, butorphanol (pain control, sedation)
- Anticholinergic: Atropine, glycopyrrolate (prevent bradycardia)

INDUCTION:
- Propofol (IV, short-acting, smooth induction)
- Alfaxalone (alternative, less cardiovascular depression)

MAINTENANCE:
- Isoflurane, sevoflurane (inhalant gas, adjustable depth)

MONITORING (Every 5-15 min):
- HR, RR, blood pressure, SpO2 (oxygen saturation), EtCO2 (end-tidal CO2)
- Temperature (hypothermia common, use warming blankets)

RECOVERY:
- Extubate when swallowing reflex returns
- Monitor until sternal recumbency (sitting up)
- Pain management: Opioids, NSAIDs (carprofen, meloxicam)

---

COMMON SURGERIES:

SPAY (Ovariohysterectomy, OVH):
- Remove ovaries + uterus (prevents pregnancy, pyometra, mammary cancer)
- Age: 6-12 months (before first heat)
- Procedure: Midline incision, ligate ovarian pedicles, uterine body
- Recovery: 10-14 days, E-collar, restrict activity

NEUTER (Castration):
- Remove testicles (prevents roaming, aggression, testicular cancer, prostate disease)
- Age: 6-12 months
- Procedure: Prescrotal incision, ligate spermatic cord
- Recovery: 7-10 days

CRUCIATE LIGAMENT REPAIR (Cranial cruciate ligament rupture, CCL):
- Symptoms: Sudden lameness, hind limb, drawer sign (tibia shifts forward)
- Surgery:
  * TPLO (Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy): Cut, rotate tibia, plate fixation (gold standard, $3,000-$5,000)
  * TTA (Tibial Tuberosity Advancement): Alternative, similar outcome
  * Lateral suture: Extracapsular, less invasive, cheaper ($1,500-$2,500), less success in large dogs
- Recovery: 12-16 weeks, strict rest, physical therapy

FOREIGN BODY REMOVAL (Enterotomy/enterectomy):
- Symptoms: Vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain
- Surgery:
  * Enterotomy: Open intestine, remove object, close
  * Enterectomy: Remove section of intestine (if necrotic, damaged), anastomosis (reconnect)
- Recovery: 7-10 days, gradual return to food (start 12-24 hours post-op)

MASS REMOVAL:
- Lipoma (benign fat tumor, common in older dogs): Remove if large, interfering with movement
- Mast cell tumor (skin cancer, dogs): Excise with wide margins (2-3 cm), submit for histopathology
  * Grade I: Low risk, surgery alone
  * Grade II-III: High risk, consider chemotherapy (vinblastine, lomustine)

## Emergency Medicine

```markdown
TRIAGE (Assess urgency):

CRITICAL (Treat immediately):
- Respiratory distress (open-mouth breathing, cyanosis)
- Severe bleeding
- Unconscious, seizure
- Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV, bloat)
- Urethral obstruction (male cats, straining, painful)
- Toxicity (antifreeze, rodenticide, chocolate)

URGENT (Treat within 1 hour):
- Trauma (hit by car, fractures)
- Dystocia (difficulty giving birth, >2 hours straining)
- Severe vomiting/diarrhea (dehydration)
- Hyphema (blood in eye)

NON-URGENT (Stable, can wait):
- Lameness (chronic, weight-bearing)
- Ear infection
- Skin issue (itching, but eating/drinking normally)

---

COMMON EMERGENCIES:

GASTRIC DILATATION-VOLVULUS (GDV, Bloat):
- Symptoms: Distended abdomen, non-productive retching, restlessness, rapid deterioration
- Breeds: Large, deep-chested (Great Dane, German Shepherd, Standard Poodle)
- Pathophysiology: Stomach fills with gas, twists (cuts off blood flow, spleen, stomach)
- Diagnostics: X-rays (stomach enlarged, "double bubble" sign)
- Treatment:
  1. STABILIZE: IV fluids (shock), decompress stomach (tube or trocharize - needle through body wall)
  2. SURGERY: Untwist stomach, gastropexy (tack stomach to body wall, prevent recurrence)
- Prognosis: 10-30% mortality (even with treatment, if delayed >6 hours, higher risk)

HEATSTROKE:
- Symptoms: Excessive panting, hyperthermia (>104°F), collapse, seizures
- Causes: Left in hot car, over-exercise in heat, brachycephalic breeds (Bulldog, Pug)
- Treatment:
  * Cool immediately (room-temp water, NOT ice - causes vasoconstriction)
  * IV fluids
  * Monitor: DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), kidney failure, brain damage
- Prevention: Never leave in car, exercise early morning/evening, provide shade/water

HIT BY CAR (HBC):
- Assessment: ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation)
- Stabilize: IV fluids, oxygen, pain control
- Diagnostics: X-rays (thorax, abdomen, limbs), ultrasound (free fluid = bleeding), bloodwork
- Common injuries:
  * Pulmonary contusions (lung bruising, monitor oxygen)
  * Pneumothorax (air in chest, thoracocentesis - drain air)
  * Fractures (stabilize, surgery)
  * Abdominal bleeding (spleen, liver - may need exploratory surgery)

TOXICITIES:

CHOCOLATE:
- Toxic dose: Depends on type (milk < dark < baking)
  * Theobromine + caffeine (methylxanthines)
  * Toxic: >20 mg/kg (mild), >40 mg/kg (moderate), >60 mg/kg (severe)
- Symptoms: Vomiting, diarrhea, hyperactivity, tremors, seizures, arrhythmias
- Treatment: Induce vomiting (if <2 hours), activated charcoal, IV fluids, supportive care

ANTIFREEZE (Ethylene glycol):
- Extremely toxic (sweet taste, pets drink)
- Symptoms:
  * Stage 1 (1-12 hours): "Drunk" (ataxia, vomiting)
  * Stage 2 (12-24 hours): Apparent recovery (deceiving)
  * Stage 3 (24-72 hours): Kidney failure, death
- Treatment: Antidote (fomepizole, if within 8-12 hours), or ethanol (vodka, IV - competes for metabolism)
- Prognosis: Poor if delayed (kidney damage irreversible)

RODENTICIDE:
- Types:
  * Anticoagulant (warfarin, brodifacoum): Blocks vitamin K, prevents clotting
    - Symptoms: Bleeding (gums, nose, urine, bruising), 3-7 days post-ingestion
    - Treatment: Vitamin K1 (3-6 weeks), blood transfusion if severe
  * Bromethalin: Neurotoxic, cerebral edema
    - Symptoms: Tremors, seizures, paralysis
    - Treatment: Induce vomiting, supportive care (no antidote)

## Client Communication

```markdown
EXAM ROOM COMMUNICATION:

LISTEN:
- Owner's chief complaint (why they came)
- History (how long, any treatments tried, any changes at home)
- Avoid interrupting (let them finish, then ask questions)

EXPLAIN:
- Diagnosis: Layman's terms (not medical jargon)
  * NOT: "Your dog has gastroenteritis secondary to dietary indiscretion"
  * BETTER: "Your dog has an upset stomach from eating something he shouldn't have"
- Treatment plan: Why each step
  * "I'm recommending bloodwork to check his liver and kidney function, to make sure his organs are handling the infection well"

OPTIONS:
- Present choices (cost, benefits, risks)
- Example: "We can do X-rays today for $150, which will tell us if there's a foreign body. Or we can start with bland diet and monitor for 24 hours. If he doesn't improve, X-rays would be the next step."

---

EUTHANASIA:

WHEN:
- Quality of life assessment:
  * Pain (uncontrolled, despite medication)
  * Eating/drinking (refusing, weight loss)
  * Mobility (can't stand, walk, or lies in urine/feces)
  * More bad days than good

PROCEDURE:
1. IV catheter (if possible)
2. Sedation (propofol or dexmedetomidine + butorphanol, optional but recommended)
3. Euthanasia solution (pentobarbital, IV overdose)
4. Auscult heart (confirm death)
5. Give time with pet (as long as needed)

AFTERCARE:
- Options: Home burial (if legal), cremation (private or communal), rendering
- Paw print, fur clipping (mementos)

SUPPORT:
- Empathy: "I'm so sorry for your loss. I know how much [pet name] meant to you."
- Normalize grief (pets are family, grief is real)
- Resources: Pet loss hotlines, support groups

---

DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS:

FINANCIAL LIMITATIONS:
- Non-judgmental (many people want best care, but can't afford)
- Present options: Gold standard, middle ground, bare minimum
- Payment plans (CareCredit, Scratchpay)
- Surrender to rescue (if owner can't afford treatment, but don't want euthanasia)

COMPLIANCE ISSUES:
- "I understand it's hard to give pills. Let's troubleshoot. Have you tried hiding it in cheese? Pill pockets?"
- Offer alternatives: Injectable (long-acting), transdermal (rub on ear), liquid
- Follow-up: "Let's check back in 1 week to see how it's going"

NON-COMPLIANCE (Client refuses recommended treatment):
- Respect autonomy (it's their pet, their choice)
- Document: "Discussed risks of not treating, owner declined"
- Offer alternatives (if any): "If you don't want surgery, we can try pain management, but the limp may not fully resolve"
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Systematic approach** - Physical exam (head to tail), diagnostics (rule in/out), treatment plan
2. **Communicate clearly** - Avoid jargon (explain like talking to family member)
3. **Advocate for patient** - Pet can't speak (you're their voice)
4. **Empathy** - Clients stressed, worried (kindness goes long way)
5. **Lifelong learning** - Medicine evolves (stay current, CE courses, journals)
