## Comprehensive Eye Examination

```markdown
PATIENT HISTORY:

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
- "Why are you here today?"
- Common: Blurry vision, headaches, eye pain, red eyes, floaters, double vision

OCULAR HISTORY:
- Previous eye problems (surgeries, injuries, diseases)
- Last eye exam (when, any changes in prescription)
- Current eyewear (glasses, contact lenses - how long wearing, any issues)
- Family history (glaucoma, macular degeneration, cataracts - genetic risk)

MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Systemic conditions affecting eyes:
  * Diabetes (diabetic retinopathy, #1 cause blindness in working-age adults)
  * Hypertension (hypertensive retinopathy)
  * Autoimmune (Sjögren's = dry eye, lupus = scleritis)
  * Thyroid (Graves' disease = exophthalmos, double vision)
- Medications:
  * Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine, for lupus/RA) → retinal toxicity (bull's eye maculopathy)
  * Tamoxifen (breast cancer) → retinal deposits
  * Steroids (oral, inhaled) → cataracts, glaucoma
  * Antihistamines, antidepressants → dry eye

VISUAL ACUITY (How well you see):

SNELLEN CHART (Distance vision, 20 feet):
- 20/20: Normal (read line at 20 feet that normal person reads at 20 feet)
- 20/40: Read at 20 feet what normal person reads at 40 feet (worse)
- 20/15: Better than normal (read at 20 feet what normal person reads at 15 feet)
- Legal blindness: 20/200 or worse (with correction)

TESTING:
- With current glasses (if wearing)
- Pinhole test (if acuity poor, improves? = refractive error, not improves? = pathology)
- Each eye separately (cover one eye)

NEAR VISION (Reading):
- Jaeger chart, near card (16 inches from eye)
- Presbyopia (age >40, can't read small print) → need reading glasses or bifocals

---

REFRACTION (Determine prescription):

OBJECTIVE REFRACTION (Autorefractor, Retinoscopy):
- Starting point (machine measures refractive error)
- Autorefractor: Quick, automated, patient looks at target
- Retinoscopy: Manual, shine light in eye, observe reflection, adjust lenses

SUBJECTIVE REFRACTION (Patient feedback, Phoropter):
- "Which is better, 1 or 2?" (compare lenses)
- Refine prescription (sphere, cylinder, axis)

PRESCRIPTION FORMAT:
- OD (right eye), OS (left eye)
- Sphere (SPH): +/− power (myopia = nearsighted = minus, hyperopia = farsighted = plus)
- Cylinder (CYL): Astigmatism (cornea not perfectly round)
- Axis: Direction of astigmatism (0-180°)
- Add: Reading addition (presbyopia, bifocals/progressives)

EXAMPLE:
OD: -2.00 -1.00 × 180  (Myopia + astigmatism)
OS: -2.50 -0.75 × 175
Add: +2.00 (Reading addition)

---

PUPIL TESTING:

DIRECT RESPONSE:
- Shine light in right eye → right pupil constricts (normal)

CONSENSUAL RESPONSE:
- Shine light in right eye → left pupil also constricts (normal, via optic chiasm)

SWINGING FLASHLIGHT TEST (Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect, RAPD):
- Shine light back and forth between eyes
- Normal: Both pupils constrict equally
- RAPD: One pupil dilates when light shined in that eye (paradoxical dilation)
  * Cause: Optic nerve disease (optic neuritis, glaucoma, tumor)
  * EMERGENCY if sudden (optic neuritis → multiple sclerosis, giant cell arteritis)

---

EXTRAOCULAR MOTILITY (EOM, Eye movements):

6 DIRECTIONS OF GAZE:
- Up and right, up and left
- Right, left
- Down and right, down and left

ASSESSMENT:
- Follow target (pen, finger) in H-pattern
- Smooth pursuit (no jerking)
- Full range (reaches all positions)
- Binocular (both eyes move together)

ABNORMAL:
- Restriction (can't move fully in one direction, e.g., thyroid eye disease)
- Nystagmus (involuntary eye shaking, neurologic, vestibular)
- Strabismus (misalignment, crossed eyes, lazy eye)

---

CONFRONTATION VISUAL FIELDS:

TECHNIQUE:
- Patient covers one eye, looks at your nose
- You wiggle fingers in 4 quadrants (superior, inferior, nasal, temporal)
- "Tell me when you see my fingers move"

NORMAL: Sees in all quadrants
ABNORMAL:
- Hemianopia (half visual field missing, stroke, brain tumor)
- Quadrantanopia (quarter visual field, optic pathway lesion)
- Scotoma (blind spot, glaucoma, macular degeneration)

FORMAL TEST: Humphrey Visual Field (automated perimetry, detailed, for glaucoma monitoring)

---

TONOMETRY (Intraocular pressure, IOP):

GOLDMANN APPLANATION (Gold standard):
- Blue dye in eye, slit lamp, measure force to flatten cornea
- Normal: 10-21 mmHg
- Glaucoma suspect: >21 mmHg (not diagnostic alone, need optic nerve assessment)

NON-CONTACT TONOMETRY (Air-puff):
- Quick, no contact, less accurate
- Screening tool (if high, recheck with Goldmann)

FACTORS AFFECTING IOP:
- Time of day (higher in morning, diurnal variation)
- Central corneal thickness (thick cornea = falsely high reading, thin = falsely low)
- Holding breath, Valsalva → increases IOP temporarily

---

SLIT LAMP EXAMINATION (Biomicroscopy):

EXTERNAL:
- Lids, lashes (blepharitis = crusty, inflamed lid margins)
- Conjunctiva (red = conjunctivitis, yellow = jaundice/liver)
- Cornea (abrasion, ulcer, foreign body, scars)
  * Fluorescein dye (stains defects, glows green under blue light)
- Anterior chamber (depth, cells = inflammation, blood = hyphema)
- Iris (shape, color, neovascularization = diabetes)
- Lens (cataract = cloudy lens, nuclear, cortical, posterior subcapsular)

POSTERIOR (Dilated exam):
- Vitreous (floaters, vitreous detachment, hemorrhage)
- Retina:
  * Optic nerve (cup-to-disc ratio, glaucoma if >0.6, asymmetry between eyes)
  * Macula (central vision, macular degeneration, drusen, hemorrhage)
  * Vessels (retinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, diabetic/hypertensive retinopathy)
  * Periphery (retinal tears, detachment, lattice degeneration)

DILATION:
- Drops: Tropicamide 1%, phenylephrine 2.5%
- Effect: Blurry vision, light sensitivity (2-4 hours)
- Why: See back of eye (retina, optic nerve)
- Frequency: Annual (or as needed, diabetics every 6-12 months)

## Common Eye Conditions

```markdown
REFRACTIVE ERRORS:

MYOPIA (Nearsightedness, see near clearly, distance blurry):
- Eyeball too long, or cornea too curved
- Correction: Minus lenses (diverge light)
- Increasing prevalence (50% of population, 80% in some Asian countries)
- Myopia control (children):
  * Orthokeratology (overnight rigid lenses, reshape cornea)
  * Atropine 0.01% (low-dose, slows progression)
  * Multifocal contact lenses (peripheral defocus)

HYPEROPIA (Farsightedness, see distance clearly, near blurry):
- Eyeball too short, or cornea too flat
- Correction: Plus lenses (converge light)
- Often asymptomatic in young (accommodation compensates)
- Symptoms in older: Eyestrain, headaches, blurry near vision

ASTIGMATISM (Blurry at all distances):
- Cornea not perfectly round (football-shaped, not basketball)
- Correction: Cylindrical lenses (different power in different meridians)

PRESBYOPIA (Age-related, can't focus near, >40 years):
- Lens loses flexibility (can't accommodate)
- Symptoms: Hold reading material at arm's length, blurry up close
- Correction:
  * Reading glasses (single vision, +1.00 to +3.00)
  * Bifocals (distance + reading, visible line)
  * Progressives (gradual transition, no line, most popular)
  * Multifocal contact lenses

---

CATARACTS:

SYMPTOMS:
- Gradual blurry vision (not sudden)
- Glare, halos around lights (especially at night)
- Difficulty reading, driving at night
- Colors appear faded, yellowed

TYPES:
- Nuclear (center of lens, age-related, most common)
- Cortical (spokes from periphery, diabetes)
- Posterior subcapsular (back of lens, steroid use, younger patients)

TREATMENT:
- Early: Update glasses prescription (may improve vision temporarily)
- Surgery (only treatment, when vision affects daily life):
  * Phacoemulsification (ultrasound breaks up lens, remove through small incision)
  * Intraocular lens (IOL) implanted (replace natural lens)
  * Outpatient (20 min procedure, local anesthesia)
  * Recovery: 1-2 weeks, vision improves gradually
  * Complications (rare): Infection (<1%), retinal detachment (1-2%), posterior capsule opacification (20%, years later, laser treatment)

TIMING:
- Not an emergency (schedule when convenient)
- Wait until vision significantly impaired (can't pass driving test, difficulty reading, work)

---

GLAUCOMA (Optic nerve damage, vision loss):

RISK FACTORS:
- Elevated IOP (>21 mmHg, but can have glaucoma with normal IOP)
- Age >60
- Family history (first-degree relative, 10× risk)
- African ancestry (6× risk, earlier onset, more aggressive)
- Myopia (high nearsightedness)

SYMPTOMS:
- None in early stages (silent thief of sight)
- Peripheral vision loss (late, advanced)
- Tunnel vision (end-stage)

DIAGNOSIS:
- Elevated IOP (not diagnostic alone, 30% have normal-tension glaucoma)
- Optic nerve: Cupping (cup-to-disc ratio >0.6, asymmetry between eyes >0.2)
- Visual field defects (Humphrey VF, paracentral scotomas, arcuate defects)
- OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography): RNFL thickness (retinal nerve fiber layer, thinning = damage)

TREATMENT (Goal: Lower IOP):
- MEDICATIONS (First-line, eye drops):
  * Prostaglandin analogs (Latanoprost, Travoprost): 1× daily, most effective (↓IOP 25-30%)
    - Side effects: Eyelash growth, iris darkening, periocular hyperpigmentation
  * Beta-blockers (Timolol): 2× daily, ↓aqueous production
    - Side effects: Bradycardia, bronchospasm (avoid in asthma, COPD, heart block)
  * Alpha-agonists (Brimonidine): 2-3× daily
  * Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (Dorzolamide, Brinzolamide): 2-3× daily
- LASER (If medications insufficient):
  * SLT (Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty): Improve drainage, ↓IOP 20-30%, lasts 1-5 years
- SURGERY (If medications + laser fail):
  * Trabeculectomy (create drainage hole, gold standard, complications: infection, hypotony)
  * Tube shunt (Ahmed, Baerveldt, drainage device)
  * MIGS (Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery): iStent, Trabectome (less invasive, moderate IOP reduction)

MONITORING:
- Lifelong (chronic disease, no cure)
- IOP checks every 3-6 months
- Visual fields annually
- OCT annually (RNFL, detect progression)

---

AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD, central vision loss):

RISK FACTORS:
- Age >60 (most common cause vision loss in older adults)
- Smoking (2-4× risk)
- Caucasian (higher risk than other races)
- Family history

TYPES:

DRY AMD (90%, slow progression):
- Drusen (yellow deposits under retina)
- Geographic atrophy (advanced, loss of photoreceptors)
- Symptoms: Gradual blurry central vision, difficulty reading
- Treatment:
  * AREDS2 vitamins (Vitamin C, E, zinc, copper, lutein, zeaxanthin)
  * Reduce risk progression to wet AMD (25% over 5 years → 10%)
  * Does NOT reverse vision loss (only slows progression)

WET AMD (10%, rapid progression, more severe):
- Abnormal blood vessels grow under retina (choroidal neovascularization, CNV)
- Leak fluid, blood → distortion, central blind spot
- Symptoms: Sudden distorted vision (straight lines appear wavy), dark/blank spot in center
- Diagnosis: OCT (fluid in macula), fluorescein angiography (leaking vessels)
- Treatment:
  * Anti-VEGF injections (intravitreal, into vitreous cavity):
    - Medications: Lucentis (ranibizumab), Eylea (aflibercept), Avastin (bevacizumab, off-label)
    - Frequency: Monthly initially (loading dose, 3-6 months), then PRN or every 2-3 months
    - Goal: Dry macula, stop leakage, stabilize/improve vision
  * Prognosis: 30-40% improve vision, 50% stabilize, 10-20% worsen
  * Complications (rare): Infection (<1/1000), retinal detachment, cataract progression

MONITORING:
- Amsler grid (home test, check daily if high-risk or diagnosed):
  * Grid of straight lines
  * If lines appear wavy, distorted, or missing → call ophthalmologist (possible wet AMD)

DIABETIC RETINOPATHY (DR, #1 cause blindness in working-age adults):

STAGES:

1. NO DR (No abnormalities)
2. MILD NPDR (Non-proliferative DR): Microaneurysms (dot hemorrhages)
3. MODERATE NPDR: Hemorrhages, exudates (lipid deposits, cotton-wool spots)
4. SEVERE NPDR: "4-2-1 rule" (hemorrhages in 4 quadrants, venous beading in 2 quadrants, or IRMA in 1 quadrant)
5. PROLIFERATIVE DR (PDR): Neovascularization (new blood vessels), vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment

MACULAR EDEMA (DME, Diabetic Macular Edema):
- Fluid leaks into macula (central vision affected)
- #1 cause vision loss in diabetics
- Can occur at any stage

TREATMENT:
- PREVENTION (Most important):
  * Tight glycemic control (HbA1c <7%, reduces risk 76%)
  * Blood pressure control (<140/90)
  * Lipid control (statins)
- LASER (PRP, Panretinal Photocoagulation):
  * For proliferative DR (PDR)
  * Destroy peripheral retina (reduce oxygen demand, stop neovascularization)
  * Preserves central vision (sacrifices peripheral)
- ANTI-VEGF INJECTIONS:
  * For DME, or proliferative DR
  * Reduce fluid, stop neovascularization
  * Monthly initially, then PRN
- VITRECTOMY (Surgery):
  * For non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment

SCREENING:
- Type 1 diabetes: 5 years after diagnosis, then annually
- Type 2 diabetes: At diagnosis, then annually
- Pregnancy: Before conception, each trimester (DR can worsen during pregnancy)

---

DRY EYE DISEASE:

SYMPTOMS:
- Burning, stinging, gritty sensation
- Watery eyes (reflex tearing, paradoxical)
- Blurry vision (fluctuates with blinking)
- Worse end of day, with reading, computer use

CAUSES:
- Aqueous deficiency (not enough tears, Sjögren's, medications)
- Evaporative (tears evaporate too quickly, meibomian gland dysfunction, MGD)

TREATMENT:
- ARTIFICIAL TEARS (First-line):
  * Preservative-free (if using >4× daily, preservatives irritate)
  * Brands: Systane, Refresh, Blink
- PUNCTAL PLUGS (Block tear drainage):
  * Insert in puncta (tear duct opening)
  * Keep tears on eye longer
  * Temporary (collagen, dissolves) or permanent (silicone)
- PRESCRIPTION DROPS:
  * Restasis (cyclosporine 0.05%): Anti-inflammatory, increases tear production (takes 3-6 months)
  * Xiidra (lifitegrast): Anti-inflammatory (faster onset, 2-4 weeks)
- WARM COMPRESSES + LID MASSAGE:
  * For MGD (meibomian gland dysfunction)
  * Melt oil, express glands
  * 5-10 min, 2× daily
- OMEGA-3 SUPPLEMENTS (Fish oil):
  * Reduce inflammation
  * Dose: 1000-2000 mg EPA+DHA daily

LIFESTYLE:
- Blink frequently (especially at computer)
- 20-20-20 rule (Every 20 min, look 20 feet away, for 20 sec)
- Humidifier (dry environments)
- Avoid direct air (fans, car vents)

## Contact Lenses

```markdown
TYPES:

SOFT LENSES (Most common):
- Material: Hydrogel, silicone hydrogel (higher oxygen transmission)
- Replacement: Daily disposable (best for dry eye, allergy), biweekly, monthly
- Pros: Comfortable, easy to adapt, affordable
- Cons: Less sharp vision (for high astigmatism), deposits buildup

RIGID GAS PERMEABLE (RGP):
- Material: Hard, oxygen-permeable plastic
- Pros: Sharper vision, durable (1-2 years), better for astigmatism, keratoconus
- Cons: Longer adaptation (1-2 weeks), can dislodge

SPECIALTY LENSES:
- Toric (Astigmatism correction)
- Multifocal (Presbyopia, bifocal/progressive)
- Scleral (Large diameter, vault cornea, for keratoconus, severe dry eye)

---

FITTING:

BASE CURVE (BC):
- Curvature of lens (matches cornea curvature)
- Too flat: Moves excessively, discomfort, poor vision
- Too steep: Tight, reduced oxygen, corneal swelling

DIAMETER (DIA):
- Size of lens (typically 14.0-14.5 mm for soft)

POWER (PWR):
- Prescription (may differ slightly from glasses, vertex distance)

ASSESSMENT:
- Centration (lens centered on cornea)
- Movement (blink, should move slightly 1-2 mm)
- Coverage (soft lens covers entire cornea + some sclera)

---

CARE & HYGIENE:

DAILY DISPOSABLES:
- Best (no cleaning, fresh lens daily)
- Discard after use (never reuse)

REUSABLE LENSES:
- Clean after each wear:
  * Multipurpose solution (Clean, rinse, disinfect, store)
  * Rub lenses (even if "no-rub" solution, removes debris better)
  * Replace solution daily (never top off old solution)
- Replace case every 3 months (biofilm, bacteria)

AVOID:
- Water (tap, shower, swimming pool, hot tub) → Acanthamoeba keratitis (sight-threatening)
- Sleeping in lenses (30-day extended wear lenses exist, but higher infection risk 5-10×)
- Over-wearing (follow replacement schedule, daily = daily, not 2-3 days)

COMPLICATIONS:
- Corneal ulcer (Infection, pain, red eye, discharge, blurry vision)
  * EMERGENCY: Remove lens, see doctor immediately, culture, start antibiotics
  * Can scar → permanent vision loss
- Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC, allergic reaction, bumps under upper lid, mucus)
- Dry eye (reduce wearing time, use rewetting drops, consider daily disposables)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Comprehensive exams** - Not just refraction (check ocular health, glaucoma, cataracts, retina)
2. **Early detection** - Many eye diseases asymptomatic early (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, AMD)
3. **Systemic health** - Eyes reflect overall health (diabetes, hypertension, autoimmune)
4. **Patient education** - Explain conditions, treatment options, compliance critical
5. **Referral when needed** - Know limits (complex cataracts, retinal surgery, neuro-ophthalmology → ophthalmologist)
