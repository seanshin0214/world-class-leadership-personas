## Common Conditions

### Gastroenteritis (Vomiting & Diarrhea)

```markdown
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:

DIETARY:
- Dietary indiscretion ("garbage gut")
- Food allergy/intolerance
- Abrupt diet change

INFECTIOUS:
- Parvovirus (puppies, bloody diarrhea)
- Coronavirus
- Giardia (zoonotic!)
- Salmonella

TOXIC:
- Chocolate, grapes, xylitol, NSAIDs
- Household cleaners

METABOLIC:
- Pancreatitis
- Kidney disease
- Liver disease

OBSTRUCTION:
- Foreign body (toy, sock, bone)
- Intussusception

---

TREATMENT:

MILD (Outpatient):
- Withhold food 12-24 hours (water ok)
- Bland diet (boiled chicken + rice) 3-5 days
- Probiotics
- Anti-nausea: Cerenia (maropitant) 1mg/kg SQ q24h
- Monitor for worsening

MODERATE-SEVERE (Hospitalize):
- IV fluids (LRS or Normosol-R)
  * Dehydration % × BW (kg) × 1000 = mL deficit
  * Plus maintenance: 60-80 mL/kg/day
- Anti-nausea: Cerenia, Ondansetron
- Antacids: Omeprazole 1mg/kg PO q24h
- Antibiotics if febrile/septic: Ampicillin, Metronidazole

RED FLAGS (Surgery?):
🚩 Abdominal pain
🚩 Distended abdomen
🚩 Vomiting after drinking
🚩 Radiographs: Obstruction, free gas
→ Exploratory laparotomy

---

PARVOVIRUS PROTOCOL:

HOSPITALIZATION:
- Isolation (highly contagious!)
- Aggressive IV fluids (shock doses if needed)
- Anti-nausea: Cerenia, Ondansetron
- Antibiotics: Ampicillin + Enrofloxacin (prevent sepsis)
- Nutritional support: NG tube if not eating
- Pain management: Buprenorphine
- Monitor: Glucose, electrolytes q6-12h

PROGNOSIS:
- With treatment: 70-90% survival
- Without treatment: 10% survival

PREVENTION:
- Vaccination (DHPP series starting 6-8 weeks)
```

### Otitis Externa (Ear Infection)

```markdown
DIAGNOSIS:

HISTORY:
- Head shaking, scratching
- Odor, discharge

PHYSICAL EXAM:
- Erythema, swelling
- Discharge (color, amount)
- Pain on palpation

OTOSCOPIC EXAM:
- Tympanic membrane intact?
- Foreign body?
- Polyps, tumors?

CYTOLOGY (Essential!):
- Swab ear canal
- Roll on slide
- Stain (Diff-Quik)
- Examine under microscope

FINDINGS:
- Cocci (bacteria, Staph)
- Rods (bacteria, Pseudomonas)
- Yeast (Malassezia, budding)
- Mites (Otodectes, 8 legs)

---

TREATMENT:

PRIMARY CAUSE:
- Allergies (most common)
- Foreign body
- Parasites
- Endocrine (hypothyroid)

SECONDARY INFECTION:
- Based on cytology

COCCI (Staph):
- Otomax (gentamicin + betamethasone + clotrimazole)
- 5-10 drops q12h × 7-14 days

RODS (Pseudomonas):
- Baytril Otic (enrofloxacin + silver sulfadiazine)
- 5-10 drops q12h × 14 days

YEAST (Malassezia):
- Claro (florfenicol + terbinafine + mometasone)
- Single dose (lasts 30 days)

CLEANING:
- Avoid Q-tips (push debris deeper!)
- Ear cleaner: Epi-Otic, TrizUltra+Keto
- Fill canal, massage base, let dog shake
- Wipe outer canal

RECHECK:
- 7-14 days
- Repeat cytology (confirm clearance)
```

## Surgery

### Ovariohysterectomy (Spay)

```markdown
INDICATIONS:
- Population control
- Prevent pyometra (uterine infection)
- Reduce mammary tumor risk (if done <2.5 years)

PROCEDURE:

PRE-OP:
- Physical exam, bloodwork (if >7 years)
- Fasting 8-12 hours
- IV catheter, fluid therapy

ANESTHESIA:
- Premedication: Dexmedetomidine + Hydromorphone
- Induction: Propofol IV to effect
- Maintenance: Isoflurane or Sevoflurane (gas)
- Monitoring: Heart rate, SpO2, capnography, BP

SURGERY:
1. Ventral midline incision (umbilicus to pubis)
2. Locate ovarian pedicle (suspend body wall)
3. Ligate ovarian pedicle (3-clamp technique or LigaSure)
4. Ligate uterine body
5. Remove ovaries + uterus
6. Close body wall (3-layer: linea alba, SQ, skin)

POST-OP:
- Pain management: Carprofen 2mg/kg PO q12h × 3 days
- E-collar (prevent licking)
- Restrict activity 10-14 days
- Suture removal 10-14 days

COMPLICATIONS:
- Bleeding (most common, emergency!)
- Infection (<5%)
- Seroma (fluid pocket under incision)

---

OVARIAN REMNANT SYNDROME:
- Signs of heat after spay
- Tissue left behind (resorption of suture)
- Treatment: Re-explore, remove remnant
```

---

### Dental Prophylaxis

```markdown
PROCEDURE:

PRE-OP:
- Bloodwork (anesthesia risk)
- Fasting

ANESTHESIA:
- Intubate (protect airway from water)

CLEANING:
1. Supragingival scaling (ultrasonic scaler)
   - Remove visible tartar
2. Subgingival scaling (curettes)
   - Below gumline (most important!)
3. Polishing (pumice paste)
   - Smooth enamel (reduce plaque buildup)
4. Fluoride treatment

CHARTING:
- Record each tooth (dogs: 42, cats: 30)
- Missing, mobile, fractured
- Periodontal pockets (>5mm = disease)

EXTRACTIONS:
- Loose teeth (>Grade 3 mobility)
- Root canal fractures
- Severe periodontal disease

TECHNIQUE:
1. Gingival flap (elevate gum)
2. Alveolus bone removal (bur)
3. Elevate tooth (elevator)
4. Extract (forceps)
5. Flush socket
6. Close gum (absorbable suture)

POST-OP:
- Soft food 7-14 days
- Pain management: Carprofen, Gabapentin
- Antibiotics if infection: Clindamycin

DENTAL HOME CARE:
- Brushing (gold standard)
- Dental chews (Greenies, CET chews)
- Water additives
- Annual cleanings

## Emergency Medicine

```markdown
TRIAGE (Assess severity):

CRITICAL (Immediate):
- Respiratory distress (cyanosis, open-mouth breathing)
- Uncontrolled bleeding
- Unconscious
- Seizure >5 min
- Trauma (hit by car)

URGENT (Within 30 min):
- Difficulty urinating
- Severe pain
- Bloated abdomen (GDV suspect)
- Toxin ingestion (<2 hours)

NON-URGENT:
- Vomiting (1-2× today)
- Limping (non-weight bearing <24 hours)
- Ear infection

---

COMMON EMERGENCIES:

GASTRIC DILATATION-VOLVULUS (GDV / Bloat):
- Large, deep-chested dogs
- Stomach fills with gas, rotates
- LIFE-THREATENING (hours to die)

SIGNS:
- Distended abdomen (drum-tight)
- Retching without vomiting
- Restlessness, pacing
- Weak pulse, pale gums (shock)

TREATMENT:
1. Stabilize shock (IV fluids, aggressive)
2. Decompress stomach (trocar or orogastric tube)
3. SURGERY (gastropexy - tack stomach to body wall)

PROGNOSIS:
- With surgery: 80-90% survival
- Without surgery: 100% fatal

---

HIT BY CAR (Trauma):

INITIAL ASSESSMENT (ABCDE):
A - Airway (open, obstructed?)
B - Breathing (respiratory rate, effort)
C - Circulation (pulse, CRT, bleeding)
D - Disability (neurological status)
E - Exposure (wounds, fractures)

TREATMENT:
- Oxygen
- IV fluids (shock doses if needed)
- Pain management
- Stabilize fractures
- Radiographs (chest, abdomen, bones)
- Monitor 24-48 hours (pulmonary contusions develop)

---

CHOCOLATE TOXICITY:

TOXIC DOSES:
- Milk chocolate: 1 oz/lb (mild)
- Dark chocolate: 0.3 oz/lb (moderate)
- Baking chocolate: 0.1 oz/lb (severe)

SIGNS:
- Vomiting, diarrhea
- Hyperactivity, panting
- Tremors, seizures
- Arrhythmias

TREATMENT:
- If <2 hours: Induce vomiting (apomorphine, hydrogen peroxide)
- Activated charcoal (absorb toxin)
- IV fluids (enhance excretion)
- Anticonvulsants if seizing (diazepam)
- Monitor ECG (arrhythmias)

PROGNOSIS:
- Good if treated early
