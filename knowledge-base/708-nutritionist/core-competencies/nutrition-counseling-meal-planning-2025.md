## Nutritional Assessment

```markdown
ANTHROPOMETRIC DATA:

BMI (Body Mass Index):
Formula: Weight (kg) / Height (m)²

Example: 70 kg, 1.75 m
BMI = 70 / (1.75)² = 22.9

CLASSIFICATION:
- <18.5: Underweight
- 18.5-24.9: Normal
- 25-29.9: Overweight
- 30-34.9: Obesity Class I
- 35-39.9: Obesity Class II
- ≥40: Obesity Class III

LIMITATIONS:
- Doesn't distinguish muscle vs fat
- Not accurate for athletes, elderly

---

BODY COMPOSITION:

WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE:
- Men: >40 inches (102 cm) = increased risk
- Women: >35 inches (88 cm) = increased risk

WAIST-TO-HIP RATIO:
- Men: >0.90 = increased risk
- Women: >0.85 = increased risk
- Apple shape (visceral fat) > Pear shape

BODY FAT %:
- Men: 10-20% (healthy)
- Women: 18-28% (healthy)
- Methods: DEXA, BodPod, skinfold calipers

---

BIOCHEMICAL DATA:

LIPID PANEL:
- Total cholesterol: <200 mg/dL
- LDL ("bad"): <100 mg/dL (optimal)
- HDL ("good"): >60 mg/dL
- Triglycerides: <150 mg/dL

GLUCOSE:
- Fasting: 70-99 mg/dL (normal)
- 100-125 mg/dL (prediabetes)
- ≥126 mg/dL (diabetes)
- HbA1c: <5.7% (normal), 5.7-6.4% (prediabetes), ≥6.5% (diabetes)

MICRONUTRIENTS:
- Vitamin D: 30-50 ng/mL (optimal)
- Iron: Ferritin 30-200 ng/mL
- B12: >200 pg/mL

---

DIETARY INTAKE:

24-HOUR RECALL:
"What did you eat yesterday, starting when you woke up?"
- Breakfast: Oatmeal, banana, coffee
- Snack: Granola bar
- Lunch: Salad with chicken, dressing
- Snack: Apple, peanut butter
- Dinner: Pasta, marinara, garlic bread
- Evening: Ice cream

FOOD FREQUENCY QUESTIONNAIRE:
How often do you eat:
- Fruits: □ Daily □ Weekly □ Rarely
- Vegetables: □ Daily □ Weekly □ Rarely
- Fast food: □ Daily □ Weekly □ Rarely

3-DAY FOOD DIARY:
- Record everything for 3 days (2 weekdays, 1 weekend)
- Include portions, preparation methods
- More accurate than recall
```

## Energy & Macronutrient Needs

```markdown
CALORIE NEEDS:

BASAL METABOLIC RATE (BMR):
Harris-Benedict Equation:
- Men: 66 + (13.7 × weight kg) + (5 × height cm) - (6.8 × age)
- Women: 655 + (9.6 × weight kg) + (1.8 × height cm) - (4.7 × age)

Example (Woman, 30 years, 65 kg, 165 cm):
BMR = 655 + (9.6 × 65) + (1.8 × 165) - (4.7 × 30)
    = 655 + 624 + 297 - 141
    = 1435 kcal/day

TOTAL DAILY ENERGY EXPENDITURE (TDEE):
BMR × Activity Factor:
- Sedentary (little/no exercise): BMR × 1.2
- Lightly active (1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375
- Moderately active (3-5 days/week): BMR × 1.55
- Very active (6-7 days/week): BMR × 1.725
- Extra active (2× per day): BMR × 1.9

Example (lightly active):
TDEE = 1435 × 1.375 = 1973 kcal/day

---

MACRONUTRIENT DISTRIBUTION:

BALANCED DIET (AMDR - Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges):
- Carbohydrates: 45-65% of calories
- Protein: 10-35% of calories
- Fat: 20-35% of calories

Example (2000 kcal):
- Carbs: 50% = 1000 kcal ÷ 4 kcal/g = 250g
- Protein: 25% = 500 kcal ÷ 4 kcal/g = 125g
- Fat: 25% = 500 kcal ÷ 9 kcal/g = 56g

PROTEIN NEEDS:
- Sedentary: 0.8 g/kg body weight (RDA)
- Active: 1.2-1.6 g/kg
- Athlete: 1.6-2.2 g/kg
- Elderly: 1.0-1.2 g/kg (prevent sarcopenia)

Example (70 kg moderately active):
Protein = 70 kg × 1.4 g/kg = 98g/day

---

WEIGHT MANAGEMENT:

WEIGHT LOSS:
- Deficit: 500-750 kcal/day
- Expected loss: 1-2 lbs/week (0.5-1 kg)
- Too fast (>2 lbs/week) = muscle loss

WEIGHT GAIN:
- Surplus: 300-500 kcal/day
- Expected gain: 0.5-1 lb/week
- Focus: Strength training (build muscle, not fat)

PLATEAUS:
- Common after 6 months (metabolic adaptation)
- Recalculate TDEE (body weight decreased)
- Adjust calories or increase activity

## Meal Planning

```markdown
MyPlate METHOD (USDA):

## Medical Nutrition Therapy

```markdown
DIABETES:

GOALS:
- Blood sugar control (HbA1c <7%)
- Weight management
- Prevent complications

CARBOHYDRATE COUNTING:
- Consistent carbs per meal
- Example: 45-60g carbs per meal
- 1 carb choice = 15g carbs

GLYCEMIC INDEX (GI):
- Low GI (<55): Slower blood sugar rise
  * Whole grains, legumes, non-starchy vegetables
- High GI (>70): Rapid spike
  * White bread, white rice, sugary foods

PLATE METHOD (Diabetes):
┌─────────┬─────────┐
│Non-starchy│Protein│

## Behavior Change Counseling

```markdown
MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING:

OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS:
❌ "Do you want to lose weight?" (Yes/No)
✅ "What would you like to change about your eating habits?"

AFFIRMATIONS:
- "You've already made progress by tracking your food"
- "It takes courage to make these changes"

REFLECTIVE LISTENING:
Client: "I just don't have time to cook"
Counselor: "It sounds like time is a big barrier for you"

SUMMARIZE:
"So you mentioned wanting to lose 20 lbs, but you're finding it hard to cook at home because of your work schedule. You also said you eat out 5× per week. Did I get that right?"

---

SMART GOALS:

BAD:
❌ "Eat healthier"
❌ "Lose weight"
❌ "Exercise more"

GOOD:
✅ "Eat 3 servings of vegetables per day, 5 days this week"
✅ "Lose 1 lb per week for the next 4 weeks"
✅ "Walk 30 minutes, 3× per week after dinner"

(Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

---

STAGES OF CHANGE:

PRECONTEMPLATION:
- Not thinking about change
- Approach: Provide information (don't push)

CONTEMPLATION:
- Considering change (ambivalent)
- Approach: Explore pros/cons, motivational interviewing

PREPARATION:
- Planning to change soon
- Approach: Set SMART goals, action plan

ACTION:
- Actively changing
- Approach: Support, problem-solve barriers

MAINTENANCE:
- Sustaining change (>6 months)
- Approach: Prevent relapse, celebrate success

---

RELAPSE PREVENTION:

IDENTIFY TRIGGERS:
- Emotional (stress, boredom)
- Environmental (parties, holidays)
- Social (peer pressure)

COPING STRATEGIES:
- Stress → Walk, call friend, journal
- Boredom → Hobby, read, clean
- Parties → Eat before, bring healthy dish, say no

SLIP vs RELAPSE:
- Slip: One unhealthy meal (normal!)
- Relapse: Return to old habits consistently
- Recovery: Get back on track next meal (don't wait for Monday!)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Individualized** - One size doesn't fit all (culture, preferences, budget)
2. **Evidence-based** - Use research, not fads
3. **Sustainable** - Lifestyle change, not diet (long-term)
4. **Behavior focus** - Change habits, not just educate
5. **Collaborative** - Work WITH client, not for them
