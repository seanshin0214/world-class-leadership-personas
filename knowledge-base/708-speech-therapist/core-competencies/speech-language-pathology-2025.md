## Speech Sound Disorders

```markdown
ARTICULATION (Motor-based, physical difficulty producing sounds):

COMMON ERRORS:

SUBSTITUTIONS:
- Replace one sound with another
- Examples:
  * /w/ for /r/: "wed" instead of "red" (common, developmental until age 6-7)
  * /t/ for /k/: "tat" instead of "cat"
  * /f/ or /d/ for /th/: "fumb" instead of "thumb"

OMISSIONS:
- Leave out sounds (usually at end of words)
- Examples:
  * "ca" instead of "cat"
  * "bu" instead of "bus"

DISTORTIONS:
- Sound present but not quite right (approximate, but off)
- Example: Lateral /s/ (air escapes sides, "slushy")

ADDITIONS:
- Extra sounds
- Example: "buhlue" instead of "blue"

---

DEVELOPMENTAL NORMS (When sounds typically mastered):

AGE 3: /p/, /b/, /m/, /n/, /h/, /w/
AGE 4: /d/, /t/, /k/, /g/, /f/, /y/
AGE 5: /l/, /s/
AGE 6: /r/, /sh/, /ch/, /j/, /v/
AGE 7: /th/ (voiced and voiceless), /zh/ (measure)
AGE 8: /r/ blends (br, tr, dr, gr)

RED FLAG:
- If sound not mastered 6-12 months past expected age → may need therapy

---

PHONOLOGICAL PROCESSES (Pattern-based, cognitive, simplify speech):

COMMON PROCESSES:

FINAL CONSONANT DELETION:
- Omit last sound
- "ca" for "cat", "do" for "dog"
- Typical until age 3

FRONTING:
- Replace back sounds (/k/, /g/) with front sounds (/t/, /d/)
- "tat" for "cat", "do" for "go"
- Typical until age 3-3.5

STOPPING:
- Replace fricatives (/f/, /s/, /sh/) with stops (/p/, /t/)
- "pish" for "fish", "top" for "stop"
- Typical until age 3-5 (depending on sound)

CLUSTER REDUCTION:
- Simplify consonant blends
- "poon" for "spoon", "tuck" for "truck"
- Typical until age 4

GLIDING:
- Replace /l/ or /r/ with /w/ or /y/
- "wabbit" for "rabbit", "yook" for "look"
- Typical until age 5-6

---

THERAPY TECHNIQUES:

AUDITORY DISCRIMINATION:
- Teach child to HEAR difference between correct and incorrect
- Activity: "Thumbs up if I say it right, thumbs down if wrong"
  * Therapist says "wed" (thumbs down), "red" (thumbs up)

MINIMAL PAIRS:
- Words that differ by one sound (target sound)
- Example (/r/ vs /w/):
  * "rake" vs "wake"
  * "road" vs "rowed"
- Child says word, therapist responds (if says "wake" when meaning "rake" → confusion → motivation to correct)

SHAPING (Successive approximations):
- Start with sound child CAN make, gradually change to target
- Example (/r/ from /l/):
  1. Start with "luh"
  2. Pull tongue back slightly (toward /r/)
  3. Reward closer approximations
  4. Eventually reaches correct /r/

CUE HIERARCHY (Most to least support):
1. Model: "Say 'red'"
2. Phonetic cue: "Put your tongue back for /r/"
3. Visual cue: Show tongue placement (diagram, mirror)
4. Tactile cue: Touch child's throat (feel vibration for /r/)
5. Self-monitoring: "Did that sound right?"

PRACTICE PROGRESSION:
1. ISOLATION: Sound alone (/r/, /r/, /r/)
2. SYLLABLES: /ra/, /ro/, /ru/
3. WORDS: Initial (red), medial (carrot), final (car)
4. PHRASES: "red car", "big rabbit"
5. SENTENCES: "The red car is fast."
6. CONVERSATION: Spontaneous speech
7. GENERALIZATION: Outside therapy (home, school)

## Language Disorders

```markdown
RECEPTIVE LANGUAGE (Understanding):

COMPONENTS:

VOCABULARY:
- Understanding word meanings
- Deficit: Limited vocabulary, doesn't understand age-appropriate words
- Example: Doesn't know "above", "between", "before"

FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS:
- 1-step (age 2): "Give me the ball"
- 2-step (age 3): "Get the ball and put it on the table"
- 3-step (age 4+): "Get the ball, put it on the table, then sit down"
- Deficit: Can only follow 1-step when peers do 3-step

GRAMMAR (Syntax, morphology):
- Understanding sentence structure, verb tenses, plurals
- Example: "The boy is chasing the dog" vs "The dog is chasing the boy" (word order changes meaning)

WH- QUESTIONS:
- Who, what, where, when, why, how
- Deficit: Doesn't understand "why" or "how" questions (more abstract)

---

EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE (Producing):

COMPONENTS:

VOCABULARY:
- Using words to communicate
- Deficit: Limited word use, overuses "thing", "stuff", can't name objects

GRAMMAR:
- Verb tenses ("I walk" vs "I walked" vs "I am walking")
- Plurals ("cat" vs "cats")
- Pronouns ("he", "she", "they")
- Sentence structure (fragments, run-ons, word order errors)

MEAN LENGTH OF UTTERANCE (MLU):
- Average length of sentences (in morphemes, meaningful units)
- AGE 2: MLU 2.0 ("Go car", "Want cookie")
- AGE 3: MLU 3.0 ("I go in car")
- AGE 4: MLU 4.0 ("I want to go in the car")
- AGE 5: MLU 5.0+ ("I want to go in the blue car")

NARRATIVE SKILLS:
- Tell stories (beginning, middle, end)
- Sequencing events
- Deficit: Disorganized stories, missing details, unclear referents ("he did it" - who is "he"?)

---

PRAGMATICS (Social communication):

SKILLS:

CONVERSATIONAL TURN-TAKING:
- Back-and-forth (not monologue)
- Deficit: Talks AT people, doesn't listen, interrupts

TOPIC MAINTENANCE:
- Stay on topic (not random jumps)
- Deficit: Changes subject abruptly, off-topic comments

NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION:
- Eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, personal space
- Deficit: No eye contact, stands too close, doesn't use gestures

UNDERSTANDING NONLITERAL LANGUAGE:
- Idioms ("It's raining cats and dogs" ≠ animals falling from sky)
- Sarcasm ("Great job!" said sarcastically = not actually great)
- Humor, jokes
- Deficit: Takes everything literally, doesn't get jokes

PERSPECTIVE-TAKING (Theory of mind):
- Understand others' thoughts, feelings, knowledge
- Deficit: Doesn't realize listener doesn't know information, doesn't adjust explanations

---

THERAPY ACTIVITIES:

VOCABULARY:
- Semantic feature analysis (describe words: category, function, appearance, location)
  * Example (apple): Category = fruit, Function = eat, Appearance = red/round, Location = tree
- Word webs, associations (brainstorm related words)

GRAMMAR:
- Sentence expansion:
  * Start: "Dog"
  * Add: "Big dog"
  * Add: "The big dog"
  * Add: "The big dog is running"
- Sentence combining: "The dog is big. The dog is brown." → "The big brown dog."

NARRATIVE:
- Story grammar (teach structure):
  * Setting (who, where, when)
  * Problem (what's wrong)
  * Feelings (how character feels)
  * Actions (what character does)
  * Resolution (how problem solved)
- Story retell (read story, child retells with support)
- Story generation (create own story with visual prompts)

PRAGMATICS:
- Social stories (short narratives explaining social situations)
  * Example: "When I want to talk, I raise my hand and wait for the teacher to call on me."
- Role-play (practice conversations, greetings, turn-taking)
- Video modeling (watch videos of appropriate social interactions, discuss)

## Fluency Disorders

```markdown
STUTTERING (Disfluency):

TYPES:

REPETITIONS:
- Sound: "b-b-b-ball"
- Syllable: "ba-ba-ball"
- Word: "I-I-I want"
- Phrase: "I want-I want-I want a cookie"

PROLONGATIONS:
- Stretch out sound: "Sssssssnake", "Mmmmmom"

BLOCKS:
- Stuck, can't get sound out (silent pause, tension)
- "I want a... [pause, struggle] ...ball"

SECONDARY BEHAVIORS (Struggle, tension):
- Physical: Eye blinking, head nodding, facial grimacing, fist clenching
- Verbal: Interjections ("um", "uh"), revisions ("I want... I need a ball")

---

WHEN TO WORRY:

NORMAL DISFLUENCY (Age 2-5, developmental):
- Whole-word or phrase repetitions ("I-I-I want")
- <10% of words
- No struggle, tension
- Child unaware, unconcerned

STUTTERING (Needs evaluation):
- Sound/syllable repetitions ("b-b-b"), prolongations
- >10% of words
- Struggle, secondary behaviors
- Child aware, frustrated, avoids speaking
- Duration: >6 months
- Family history of stuttering

---

THERAPY APPROACHES:

YOUNG CHILDREN (Preschool, 2-5 years):

INDIRECT (Modify environment, reduce pressure):
- Slow down speech rate (model slower talking)
- Reduce questions (more comments, "I see you're building a tower" vs "What are you building?")
- Give child time to talk (don't interrupt, finish sentences)
- Praise fluent speech (not "Don't stutter", but "I like how smoothly you said that")

DIRECT (If needed, teach fluency strategies):
- Easy onset (start words gently, not hard)
- Stretchy speech (slow, smooth, like a turtle)
- Bumpy vs smooth (identify fluent vs disfluent speech)

OLDER CHILDREN/ADULTS:

FLUENCY SHAPING:
- Teach techniques:
  * Slow rate
  * Easy onset (gentle start)
  * Light articulatory contacts (less tension)
  * Continuous voicing (keep voice on, don't stop between words)
- Practice in hierarchy (words → sentences → conversation → real-life)

STUTTERING MODIFICATION (Accept stuttering, reduce struggle):
- Identify moments of stuttering (awareness)
- Cancellation (finish word, pause, say again smoothly)
- Pull-out (stutter, then ease out smoothly mid-word)
- Preparatory set (anticipate stutter, use easy onset)

COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT):
- Address anxiety, negative thoughts about stuttering
- Desensitization (voluntary stuttering, reduces fear)
- Self-disclosure ("I stutter, it might take me a moment to get my words out")
```

## Dysphagia (Swallowing Disorders)

```markdown
SWALLOW PHASES:

1. ORAL PREPARATORY (Chewing):
   - Food in mouth, chew, mix with saliva
   - Form bolus (ball of food)

2. ORAL (Tongue propulsion):
   - Tongue pushes bolus to back of mouth
   - VOLUNTARY (can control)

3. PHARYNGEAL (Throat):
   - Swallow reflex triggered
   - Epiglottis closes (protects airway, prevents aspiration)
   - Pharynx contracts (pushes food down)
   - INVOLUNTARY (automatic)

4. ESOPHAGEAL (To stomach):
   - Food travels down esophagus
   - Lower esophageal sphincter opens → food enters stomach

---

SIGNS OF DYSPHAGIA:

- Coughing/choking during or after eating
- Wet/gurgly voice after swallowing
- Food left in mouth (pocketing)
- Difficulty chewing (takes long time)
- Drooling
- Weight loss, dehydration
- Recurrent pneumonia (aspiration → food/liquid in lungs)

---

CAUSES:

NEUROLOGICAL:
- Stroke (most common, weakness/paralysis of swallow muscles)
- Parkinson's disease (reduced movement, coordination)
- ALS (progressive weakness)
- Traumatic brain injury (TBI)

STRUCTURAL:
- Head/neck cancer (surgery, radiation damage)
- Esophageal stricture (narrowing)
- Cleft palate (infants)

AGE-RELATED:
- Presbyphagia (normal aging, slower swallow, weaker muscles)

---

ASSESSMENT:

CLINICAL SWALLOW EVALUATION (CSE):
- Observe patient eat/drink various textures
- Note: Cough, voice change, effort, time to swallow

MODIFIED BARIUM SWALLOW STUDY (MBSS, Videofluoroscopy):
- X-ray video of swallow
- Patient swallows barium (shows up on X-ray)
- See: Bolus movement, airway protection, aspiration

FIBEROPTIC ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATION OF SWALLOWING (FEES):
- Camera down nose, view pharynx/larynx
- Patient swallows colored liquid/food
- See: Residue, penetration, aspiration

---

TREATMENT:

DIET MODIFICATIONS:

TEXTURES (IDDSI - International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative):
- Level 7: Regular (no modifications)
- Level 6: Soft & bite-sized (tender, fork-mashable, e.g., meatloaf, ripe banana)
- Level 5: Minced & moist (small lumps, easily chewed, e.g., ground meat, cottage cheese)
- Level 4: Pureed (smooth, no lumps, spoon-thick, e.g., applesauce, pudding, mashed potatoes)

LIQUIDS:
- Level 0: Thin (water, juice, coffee)
- Level 1: Slightly thick (thicker than water, flows through straw easily)
- Level 2: Mildly thick (flows slowly through straw, coats glass)
- Level 3: Moderately thick (effort to sip through straw, coats lips)
- Level 4: Extremely thick (pudding-like, won't flow through straw, eat with spoon)

Thickener: Add powder to liquids (SimplyThick, Thick-It)

COMPENSATORY STRATEGIES:
- Chin tuck (protect airway, reduce aspiration)
- Head turn (to weak side, direct food down stronger side)
- Multiple swallows (clear residue)
- Alternating liquids and solids (wash down food)

EXERCISES (Strengthen, improve coordination):
- Shaker exercise (head lift, strengthen throat muscles)
- Effortful swallow (squeeze hard when swallowing)
- Mendelsohn maneuver (hold larynx up during swallow, prolong pharyngeal phase)
- Tongue exercises (push against tongue depressor, resistance training)

## Augmentative & Alternative Communication (AAC)

```markdown
WHEN NEEDED:

TEMPORARY:
- Intubation (breathing tube, can't talk)
- Post-surgery (vocal cord surgery, laryngectomy)
- Aphasia (stroke, recovering speech)

PERMANENT:
- Cerebral palsy (severe, non-verbal)
- ALS (progressive, lose speech)
- Autism (non-verbal or minimally verbal)
- Intellectual disability (limited speech)

---

TYPES:

NO-TECH (Unaided):
- Gestures, sign language
- Facial expressions, eye gaze

LOW-TECH (Non-electronic):
- Picture boards (point to pictures to communicate)
- Communication books (pages of pictures, words, organized by topic)
- PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System): Give picture → get item/action

HIGH-TECH (Electronic):
- Speech-generating devices (SGD):
  * Dedicated device (Tobii Dynavox, PRC Saltillo): $5K-$15K, durable, large library
  * Tablet/iPad (Proloquo2Go, TouchChat app): $300-$500, portable, customizable
- Eye gaze systems (track eye movements, select messages): For severe physical disabilities
- Switch access (single switch, scan through options): For limited movement

---

IMPLEMENTATION:

VOCABULARY SELECTION:
- Core words (high-frequency, 80% of communication): I, want, go, more, help, stop, yes, no
- Fringe words (specific, personalized): Names, favorite foods, activities

MODELING (Aided language stimulation):
- Point to AAC while talking (show how to use)
- Example: Say "Do you want more?" while pointing to "want" and "more" on device

PROGRAMMING:
- Start simple (few options, gradually add)
- Organize by category (foods, activities, feelings)
- Personalize (add photos, names of family, favorite things)

TRAINING:
- User: Teach to navigate, select messages
- Partners: Train family, teachers, peers (how to support, wait for response, not anticipate)

MULTIMODAL:
- Combine AAC with speech, gestures, sign (use all methods available)
- AAC doesn't prevent speech development (often facilitates it, reduces frustration)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Early intervention** - Speech/language delays (sooner treatment starts, better outcomes)
2. **Functional goals** - Therapy targets real-life communication (not just perfect articulation)
3. **Family involvement** - Practice at home (carryover critical, not just therapy room)
4. **Multimodal assessment** - Standardized tests + observation + parent report (holistic view)
5. **AAC as early as needed** - Don't wait (no prerequisite skills, AAC supports language development)
