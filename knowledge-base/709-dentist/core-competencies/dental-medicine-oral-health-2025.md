## Dental Examination

```markdown
COMPREHENSIVE EXAM (New patient, annual):

MEDICAL/DENTAL HISTORY:
- Medical conditions (diabetes, heart disease, bleeding disorders, medications)
- Allergies (latex, antibiotics, anesthetics)
- Previous dental work, problems
- Current concerns (pain, bleeding, sensitivity)

EXTRAORAL EXAM:
- Face: Symmetry, swelling, lesions
- TMJ (Temporomandibular joint): Click, pop, pain, range of motion (open wide, side-to-side)
- Lymph nodes: Palpate (check for swelling, tenderness, cancer screening)
- Lips: Dryness, lesions, color

INTRAORAL EXAM:
- Soft tissues:
  * Buccal mucosa (cheeks): Ulcers, white patches (leukoplakia)
  * Tongue: Color, coating, lesions, mobility
  * Floor of mouth: Swelling, hardness (cancer screening)
  * Palate: Torus (bony growth, benign), lesions
  * Pharynx/tonsils: Inflammation, size
- Hard tissues:
  * Teeth: Count (32 adult, check for missing, extra), caries (cavities), fractures, wear, mobility
  * Restorations: Fillings, crowns, bridges (check integrity, margins, fit)
  * Occlusion: Bite alignment (Class I, II, III malocclusion)
- Gingiva (gums):
  * Color: Pink (healthy), red (inflammation), pale (anemia)
  * Texture: Stippled (orange-peel, healthy), smooth (inflammation)
  * Bleeding: Probe gently, bleeding on probing (BOP, sign of gingivitis/periodontitis)

PERIODONTAL CHARTING:
- Probing depth (measure pocket depth around each tooth, 6 sites per tooth):
  * 1-3 mm: Healthy
  * 4-5 mm: Mild/moderate periodontitis
  * 6+ mm: Severe periodontitis
- Recession (gum tissue loss, exposes root)
- Furcation involvement (bone loss between roots, molars)
- Mobility (tooth movement, grade 1-3):
  * Grade 1: <1 mm horizontal
  * Grade 2: 1+ mm horizontal
  * Grade 3: Vertical movement

RADIOGRAPHS (X-rays):
- Bitewings (check between teeth for cavities, bone loss)
  * Frequency: Annually (high caries risk), every 2-3 years (low risk)
- Periapical (full tooth, root, surrounding bone)
  * Indications: Pain, swelling, abscess, root canal, implant
- Panoramic (entire mouth, jaw, sinuses, TMJ)
  * Indications: Impacted teeth, jaw pathology, pre-orthodontics

CANCER SCREENING:
- Visual/tactile exam (tongue, floor of mouth, palate, pharynx)
- High-risk areas: Lateral/ventral tongue, floor of mouth
- Red flags: Non-healing ulcer (>2 weeks), white/red patches, lumps, asymmetry
- Refer for biopsy if suspicious

---

DIAGNOSIS:

CARIES (Cavities):
- Etiology: Bacteria (Streptococcus mutans) + sugar → acid → demineralization
- Classification (GV Black):
  * Class I: Pits and fissures (chewing surfaces, molars)
  * Class II: Interproximal posterior (between molars/premolars)
  * Class III: Interproximal anterior (between incisors, no incisal edge)
  * Class IV: Interproximal anterior (includes incisal edge)
  * Class V: Cervical (near gumline)
  * Class VI: Incisal edge, cusp tips

PERIODONTAL DISEASE:
- Gingivitis: Reversible inflammation (gums red, swollen, bleed, no bone loss)
- Periodontitis: Irreversible bone loss (pockets >4 mm, attachment loss, tooth mobility)
  * Mild: 1-2 mm attachment loss
  * Moderate: 3-4 mm
  * Severe: 5+ mm

PULPITIS (Tooth nerve inflammation):
- Reversible: Short pain to cold, resolves quickly (may not need root canal)
- Irreversible: Lingering pain (>30 sec), spontaneous pain, pain to heat (needs root canal)

ABSCESS (Infection):
- Periapical: Infection at root tip (from dead pulp, root canal failure)
  * Symptoms: Swelling, pain, tender to touch, pus
- Periodontal: Infection in gum pocket (from periodontal disease, foreign body)

## Restorative Dentistry

```markdown
FILLINGS (Restore cavity):

MATERIALS:

COMPOSITE RESIN (Tooth-colored):
- Pros: Aesthetic (matches tooth color), bonds to tooth, less tooth removal
- Cons: Less durable than amalgam (posterior, large fillings), more expensive, technique-sensitive (moisture control)
- Indications: Anterior, small-to-medium posterior, cosmetic

AMALGAM (Silver):
- Pros: Durable, strong (large posterior fillings), less expensive, easier/faster to place
- Cons: Aesthetic (silver, visible), more tooth removal, contains mercury (safe, ADA/FDA approved, controversy)
- Indications: Large posterior fillings (molars, heavy chewing forces)

GLASS IONOMER:
- Pros: Releases fluoride (prevents recurrent caries), bonds to tooth
- Cons: Weak (not for heavy chewing), aesthetic (opaque, not as natural)
- Indications: Root caries (gumline), pediatrics (temporary, primary teeth), core buildup

---

PROCEDURE (Composite filling):

1. ANESTHESIA:
   - Local injection (lidocaine with epinephrine, 1:100,000)
   - Wait 5-10 min for numbness

2. ISOLATION:
   - Rubber dam (ideal, keeps dry, protects airway) or cotton rolls

3. CARIES REMOVAL:
   - High-speed handpiece (drill) with water spray (cooling)
   - Remove decay (soft, brown), preserve healthy tooth structure
   - Caries detector (dye, stains infected dentin pink)

4. TOOTH PREPARATION:
   - Bevel margins (smoother blend, better aesthetics)
   - Undercuts (mechanical retention, if no bonding)

5. ETCH:
   - Phosphoric acid gel (35-37%, 15-30 sec)
   - Rinse, air dry (tooth looks chalky white, etched enamel)

6. BOND:
   - Apply bonding agent (liquid resin)
   - Light cure (blue LED light, 20 sec, hardens resin)

7. COMPOSITE PLACEMENT:
   - Layer composite (2 mm increments, prevent shrinkage)
   - Light cure each layer (20-40 sec)

8. SHAPING & POLISHING:
   - Contour (anatomic shape, occlusion)
   - Polish (smooth, reduce staining, plaque retention)

9. CHECK OCCLUSION:
   - Articulating paper (thin paper, patient bites, marks high spots)
   - Adjust (reduce high spots, comfortable bite)

---

CROWNS (Cap, covers entire tooth):

INDICATIONS:
- Large filling (tooth weak, >50% tooth structure lost)
- Root canal treated tooth (brittle, needs protection)
- Fractured tooth (cusps broken)
- Cosmetic (severe discoloration, misshapen)

MATERIALS:
- Porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM): Strong (metal substructure), aesthetic (porcelain outside)
- All-ceramic (Zirconia, E-max): Most aesthetic (no metal, translucent), strong
- Gold: Most durable (posterior, minimal tooth removal), expensive, not aesthetic

PROCEDURE:
1. Anesthesia, isolation
2. Tooth preparation:
   - Reduce tooth (1.5-2 mm all around, create space for crown)
   - Taper walls (crown retention)
   - Margin (chamfer, shoulder, where crown meets tooth)
3. Impression (mold of prepared tooth, traditional putty or digital scanner)
4. Temporary crown (acrylic, protect tooth while permanent made, 2 weeks)
5. Permanent crown cementation:
   - Try-in (check fit, bite, aesthetics)
   - Cement (permanent luting cement, resin or glass ionomer)
   - Remove excess cement, check occlusion

---

ROOT CANAL (Endodontics, remove infected/dead pulp):

INDICATIONS:
- Irreversible pulpitis (severe pain, lingering to cold/heat)
- Necrotic pulp (tooth dead, no response to cold test)
- Abscess (infection at root tip)

PROCEDURE:
1. Anesthesia, rubber dam
2. Access opening:
   - Drill into tooth (top of crown), reach pulp chamber
3. Pulp removal:
   - Files (remove infected pulp tissue from canals)
4. Cleaning & shaping:
   - Rotary files (NiTi, nickel-titanium, flexible)
   - Irrigate (sodium hypochlorite, bleach, disinfect canals)
   - Dry (paper points)
5. Obturation (seal canals):
   - Gutta-percha (rubber-like material, fill canals)
   - Sealer cement
6. Restoration:
   - Composite filling (access opening)
   - Crown (recommended, tooth brittle after RCT)

POST-OP:
- Mild discomfort (few days, ibuprofen)
- Avoid chewing on tooth (until crown placed)
- Success rate: 85-95%

## Periodontics

```markdown
NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT:

SCALING & ROOT PLANING (Deep cleaning, "SRP"):
- Indications: Gingivitis, mild-to-moderate periodontitis (pockets 4-6 mm)
- Procedure:
  * Anesthesia (local, quadrant by quadrant)
  * Scaling: Remove calculus (tartar), plaque (below gumline)
  * Root planing: Smooth root surface (remove toxins, bacteria)
  * Frequency: 3-4 months (maintenance, prevent recurrence)
- Goal: Reduce inflammation, shrink pockets, prevent bone loss

ANTIBIOTICS (Adjunct):
- Systemic: Amoxicillin, metronidazole (aggressive periodontitis, acute infection)
- Local: Arestin (minocycline microspheres, place in pocket, slow-release)

PATIENT EDUCATION:
- Oral hygiene:
  * Brush 2× daily (2 min, soft brush, fluoride toothpaste)
  * Floss daily (removes plaque between teeth, below gumline)
  * Interdental brushes (if spaces, easier than floss)
  * Electric toothbrush (more effective, Sonicare, Oral-B)
- Risk factors:
  * Smoking (quit, major risk factor, impairs healing, immune response)
  * Diabetes (control blood sugar, diabetics higher risk)
  * Stress (reduces immune function)

---

SURGICAL TREATMENT:

FLAP SURGERY (Osseous surgery):
- Indications: Moderate-to-severe periodontitis (pockets 6+ mm, bone loss)
- Procedure:
  1. Anesthesia, incision (lift gum flap, expose bone)
  2. Debridement (remove granulation tissue, calculus from root surface)
  3. Osseous recontouring (reshape bone, eliminate defects)
  4. Suture flap (reposition gum, close with stitches)
- Goal: Reduce pocket depth, access for cleaning, improve bone architecture

BONE GRAFTING:
- Indications: Bone loss (periodontal disease, tooth extraction, implant preparation)
- Materials:
  * Autograft (patient's own bone, gold standard, from chin, ramus)
  * Allograft (cadaver bone, processed, safe)
  * Xenograft (animal bone, bovine)
  * Alloplast (synthetic, hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate)
- Procedure: Place graft material in defect, cover with membrane (guided tissue regeneration, GTR)

GUM GRAFTING (Soft tissue graft):
- Indications: Recession (exposed roots, sensitivity, aesthetics)
- Types:
  * Connective tissue graft (from palate, gold standard)
  * Free gingival graft (thicker tissue, increase keratinized gingiva)
  * Pedicle graft (adjacent tissue, slide over recession)
- Procedure: Harvest tissue (palate), place over recession, suture

EXTRACTIONS (Tooth removal):

INDICATIONS:
- Non-restorable tooth (severe decay, fracture)
- Severe periodontal disease (mobility, bone loss)
- Impacted tooth (wisdom teeth, no room to erupt)
- Orthodontic reasons (crowding, make space)
- Infection (abscess, not responding to RCT)

SIMPLE EXTRACTION:
- Tooth visible, fully erupted
- Procedure:
  1. Anesthesia (local)
  2. Elevate tooth (elevator, loosen tooth from socket)
  3. Extract (forceps, rock tooth back/forth, remove)
  4. Curette socket (remove granulation tissue, debris)
  5. Compress socket (gauze, bite down, stop bleeding)
- Post-op:
  * Gauze (30-60 min, pressure, clot formation)
  * Ice (reduce swelling, 20 min on/off, first 24 hrs)
  * Soft diet (avoid extraction site, first few days)
  * No smoking, straw (negative pressure dislodges clot, dry socket risk)

SURGICAL EXTRACTION:
- Impacted tooth (partially/fully in bone, wisdom teeth)
- Procedure:
  1. Anesthesia (local or IV sedation)
  2. Incision (flap, expose bone)
  3. Bone removal (drill, create space around tooth)
  4. Tooth sectioning (cut tooth into pieces, remove separately)
  5. Extraction (remove tooth/pieces)
  6. Suture (close flap, dissolvable stitches, 7-10 days)
- Post-op:
  * Swelling (peak 48-72 hrs, ice first 24 hrs, heat after)
  * Pain (ibuprofen 600 mg, hydrocodone if severe)
  * Antibiotics (if infection risk, amoxicillin)
  * Follow-up (1 week, check healing, remove sutures if non-dissolvable)

DRY SOCKET (Alveolar osteitis):
- Etiology: Blood clot dislodges, bone exposed
- Symptoms: Severe pain (2-3 days post-extraction), bad taste/odor
- Treatment: Irrigation (saline, remove debris), medicated dressing (eugenol paste, pain relief), pain meds

DENTAL IMPLANTS:

INDICATIONS:
- Missing tooth (single, multiple, full arch)
- Alternative to dentures, bridges (more stable, preserves bone)

COMPONENTS:
1. Implant (titanium screw, placed in bone, osseointegrates)
2. Abutment (connector between implant and crown)
3. Crown (tooth restoration, porcelain, zirconia)

PROCEDURE:
1. SURGERY (place implant):
   - Anesthesia (local or IV sedation)
   - Incision, flap (expose bone)
   - Drill (create socket in bone, precise size for implant)
   - Place implant (screw into bone)
   - Cover with gum (suture, healing cap)
   - Osseointegration (3-6 months, bone grows around implant)

2. ABUTMENT PLACEMENT:
   - Re-open gum, attach abutment (2 weeks healing)

3. CROWN:
   - Impression, fabricate crown
   - Cement or screw-retain crown to abutment

SUCCESS RATE:
- 95-98% (lower jaw), 90-95% (upper jaw, less dense bone)
- Failures: Infection (peri-implantitis), poor osseointegration, overload

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
- Uncontrolled diabetes (impaired healing)
- Heavy smoking (impairs osseointegration)
- Bisphosphonates (osteoporosis drugs, risk of osteonecrosis)
- Insufficient bone (may need bone graft first)

## Prevention

```markdown
FLUORIDE:

MECHANISM:
- Remineralization (strengthens enamel, resists acid)
- Inhibits bacterial metabolism (reduces acid production)

SOURCES:
- Water fluoridation (0.7-1.2 ppm, community water)
- Toothpaste (1,000-1,500 ppm, OTC), 5,000 ppm (prescription, high caries risk)
- Varnish (22,600 ppm, professional application, 2-4× per year)
- Rinse (0.05% daily, 0.2% weekly)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Children: Smear (grain of rice, <3 years old), pea-size (3-6 years), supervise (don't swallow)
- Adults: Brush 2× daily with fluoride toothpaste
- High caries risk: Prescription toothpaste, varnish

FLUOROSIS:
- Excessive fluoride during enamel development (white spots, brown staining)
- Prevent: Monitor fluoride intake (toothpaste, water), supervise brushing

---

DENTAL SEALANTS:

INDICATIONS:
- Pits and fissures (chewing surfaces, molars)
- High caries risk (deep grooves, difficult to clean)
- Age: 6 years (first permanent molars), 12 years (second molars)

PROCEDURE:
1. Clean tooth (pumice, remove plaque)
2. Etch (acid gel, 15 sec, create rough surface)
3. Rinse, dry
4. Apply sealant (liquid resin, flows into grooves)
5. Light cure (20 sec, hardens)

LONGEVITY:
- 5-10 years (may wear, reapply if needed)
- Check at recall (intact, replace if lost)

---

DIET COUNSELING:

CARIOGENIC FOODS (Cavity-causing):
- Sugary: Candy, soda, juice (frequent exposure = more caries)
- Sticky: Gummy candies, dried fruit (adheres to teeth, prolonged acid attack)
- Acidic: Citrus, sports drinks (erosion, enamel loss)

PROTECTIVE FOODS:
- Cheese, milk (neutralize acid, calcium, phosphate)
- Crunchy vegetables (stimulate saliva, clean teeth)
- Sugar-free gum (xylitol, stimulates saliva, inhibits bacteria)

FREQUENCY MATTERS:
- Sipping soda all day > drinking one can quickly (prolonged acid exposure)
- Snacking frequently > three meals (less time for remineralization)
- Recommendation: Limit sugary snacks/drinks, rinse with water after

---

ORAL CANCER SCREENING:

HIGH-RISK FACTORS:
- Tobacco (smoking, chewing, 90% of oral cancers)
- Alcohol (especially + tobacco, synergistic)
- HPV (Human Papillomavirus, throat cancer, increasing in young adults)
- Sun exposure (lip cancer)

SCREENING:
- Visual/tactile exam (every dental visit)
- Red flags: Non-healing ulcer (>2 weeks), white/red patches (leukoplakia, erythroplakia), lumps, numbness
- Biopsy (if suspicious, referral to oral surgeon, pathology)

EARLY DETECTION:
- Stage I (localized): 80-90% 5-year survival
- Stage IV (advanced, metastasized): 20-40%
- Emphasize: Regular dental visits, self-exam (monthly, mirror, check tongue, floor of mouth)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Prevention first** - Fluoride, sealants, hygiene (cheaper, less invasive than treatment)
2. **Periodontal disease systemic** - Link to diabetes, heart disease, stroke (treat holistically)
3. **Crown after root canal** - Protect brittle tooth (prevent fracture)
4. **Early detection saves teeth** - Regular exams, X-rays (treat caries when small)
5. **Patient education critical** - Motivate, empower (long-term oral health depends on patient)
