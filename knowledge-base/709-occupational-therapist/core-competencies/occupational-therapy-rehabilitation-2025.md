## Occupational Therapy Evaluation

```markdown
OCCUPATIONAL PROFILE:

CLIENT HISTORY:
- Current occupations (work, self-care, leisure)
- Barriers ("I can't button my shirt anymore")
- Goals ("I want to return to work as a teacher")
- Living situation (alone, with family, assisted living)

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
- "What activities are most important to you?"
- "What's preventing you from doing them?"
- "What does a typical day look like?"
- "What are your goals for therapy?"

---

ADL ASSESSMENT (Activities of Daily Living):

BASIC ADLs (BADLs):
- Bathing/showering
- Dressing
- Toileting
- Eating
- Functional mobility (transfers, wheelchair)
- Personal hygiene (brushing teeth, combing hair)

INSTRUMENTAL ADLs (IADLs):
- Meal preparation
- Housekeeping
- Laundry
- Shopping
- Medication management
- Financial management
- Driving

GRADING (FIM - Functional Independence Measure):
7 - Complete independence
6 - Modified independence (device, but no help)
5 - Supervision (cues, no physical help)
4 - Minimal assist (patient does 75%+)
3 - Moderate assist (patient does 50-74%)
2 - Maximal assist (patient does 25-49%)
1 - Total assist (patient does <25%)

Example:
- Dressing upper body: 4 (minimal assist)
- Dressing lower body: 3 (moderate assist)
- Bathing: 2 (maximal assist)

---

RANGE OF MOTION (ROM):

ACTIVE ROM (AROM):
- Patient moves joint independently
- Measures: Goniometer (protractor for joints)

PASSIVE ROM (PROM):
- Therapist moves joint
- Patient relaxed

NORMAL VALUES:
SHOULDER:
- Flexion: 0-180°
- Abduction: 0-180°
- External rotation: 0-90°
- Internal rotation: 0-70°

ELBOW:

HAND:
- MCP (knuckle) flexion: 0-90°
- PIP (middle joint) flexion: 0-100°
- DIP (tip joint) flexion: 0-90°

FUNCTIONAL ROM:
- Don't need full ROM for function
- Example: 130° shoulder flexion sufficient for most ADLs
- Goal: Functional ROM, not necessarily "normal"

---

## ADL Training

```markdown
DRESSING:

CHALLENGES:
- Limited shoulder ROM (can't reach behind back)
- Hemiplegia (one-sided weakness from stroke)
- Arthritis (painful, stiff joints)

ADAPTIVE TECHNIQUES:

UPPER BODY (shirt, bra):
- Lay shirt flat on lap
- Put weak arm in first, then strong arm
- Pull over head
- Front-closing bra (easier than back-hook)

LOWER BODY (pants, shoes):
- Sit on bed/chair (safer than standing)
- Weak leg in first
- Reacher (grab pants without bending)
- Elastic waist (easier than buttons/zippers)

SHOES:
- Slip-on (no laces)
- Elastic laces (tie once, slip on/off)
- Long-handled shoehorn

ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT:
- Button hook (holds button, pulls through hole)
- Zipper pull (large loop, easier to grasp)
- Dressing stick (hook pulls up pants, pushes off socks)
- Sock aid (flexible plastic, pull sock on without bending)

---

BATHING:

SAFETY:
- Tub bench (sit while showering)
- Grab bars (prevent falls)
- Non-slip mat (bathtub floor)
- Raised toilet seat (easier to stand up)

TECHNIQUE:
- Wash weak side first (while strong side fresh)
- Long-handled sponge (reach back, feet)
- Handheld showerhead (sit, direct water)

---

EATING:

CHALLENGES:
- Weak grip (drop utensils)
- Tremor (spill food)
- One-handed (stroke)

ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT:
- Built-up handles (foam, easier to grip)
- Weighted utensils (reduce tremor)
- Scoop dish (curved edge, food doesn't fall off)
- Non-slip mat (plate stays in place)
- Rocker knife (one-handed cutting, rocking motion)

TECHNIQUE:
- Plate guard (clip-on edge, prevents food spilling)
- Stabilize plate (non-slip mat, suction bottom)
- Cut food into small pieces (easier to manage)

---

TOILETING:

EQUIPMENT:
- Raised toilet seat (4-6 inches, easier to stand)
- Grab bars (side of toilet, wall)
- Commode (bedside toilet, if can't walk to bathroom)

TECHNIQUE:
- Wipe front to back (prevent infection)
- Stand pivot transfer (if wheelchair user)

## Hand Therapy

```markdown
COMMON CONDITIONS:

CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME:
- Compression of median nerve (wrist)
- Symptoms: Numbness, tingling (thumb, index, middle)
- Worse at night, with repetitive hand use

TREATMENT:
- Wrist splint (neutral position, night wear)
- Nerve glides (gentle stretches, reduce pressure)
- Ergonomic modifications (keyboard position, mouse)
- Surgery if conservative fails (carpal tunnel release)

---

TRIGGER FINGER:
- Tendon catches, finger locks (bent or straight)
- Painful "pop" when releasing

TREATMENT:
- Finger splint (MCP blocked in extension)
- Tendon glides (hook fist, straight fist, tabletop)
- Massage (nodule at palm)
- Steroid injection
- Surgery (release pulley)

---

DE QUERVAIN'S TENOSYNOVITIS:
- Inflammation of thumb tendons (base of thumb, wrist)
- Pain with gripping, pinching, twisting

TEST:
- Finkelstein's test (thumb in fist, ulnar deviate wrist)
- Positive if pain at radial wrist

TREATMENT:
- Thumb spica splint (immobilize thumb, wrist)
- Ice (reduce inflammation)
- Avoid aggravating activities (lifting baby, wringing towels)
- Steroid injection
- Surgery if persistent

---

TENDON REPAIR (Flexor):

PROTOCOL (Zones 1-5, fingers):

PHASE 1 (0-4 weeks post-op):
- Dorsal blocking splint (wrist flexed 20°, MCPs flexed 50°, IPs extended)
- Passive flexion (therapist bends fingers)
- Active extension (within splint, to neutral)
- NO active flexion (protect repair)

PHASE 2 (4-6 weeks):
- Wean from splint
- Begin gentle active flexion
- Light activities (no resistance)

PHASE 3 (6-8 weeks):
- Progressive strengthening
- Putty (soft → medium → firm)
- Resistance exercises

PHASE 4 (8-12 weeks):
- Full strengthening
- Return to work (modified duty)
- Full duty at 12 weeks

COMPLICATIONS:
- Adhesions (tendon stuck, limited motion)
- Rupture (if too aggressive early)

---

FRACTURE (Distal Radius):

PROTOCOL:

PHASE 1 (0-6 weeks, immobilized):
- Cast or splint
- Edema control (elevation, ice, compression)
- ROM: Shoulder, elbow (prevent stiffness)
- Finger ROM (prevent stiffness)

PHASE 2 (6-8 weeks, cast removed):
- Begin wrist ROM (gentle, pain-free)
- Forearm rotation (supination, pronation)
- Light ADLs (no heavy lifting)

PHASE 3 (8-12 weeks):
- Progressive strengthening
- Grip exercises (putty, ball squeeze)
- Weight-bearing (wall push-ups, modified plank)

PHASE 4 (12+ weeks):
- Return to normal activities
- Sport-specific training if athlete

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- 80-90% ROM by 12 weeks
- Full strength by 6 months

## Key Takeaways

1. **Client-centered** - Goals based on patient's priorities (not therapist's)
2. **Function over impairment** - Train ADLs, not just ROM/strength
3. **Compensation** - Adapt task or environment (when recovery limited)
4. **Safety** - Fall prevention, home modifications
5. **Collaboration** - Work with PT, SLP, nursing, family
