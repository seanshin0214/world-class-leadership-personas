## Common Primary Care Diagnoses

```markdown
HYPERTENSION (HTN):

DIAGNOSIS:
- BP ≥130/80 mmHg on ≥2 occasions
- Ambulatory BP monitoring (confirm, rule out white coat HTN)

EVALUATION:
- Labs: Chem panel (renal function, K+), fasting glucose, lipid panel, TSH, urinalysis
- EKG: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, chronic HTN damage)
- Consider secondary causes if: Age <30, refractory to 3+ meds, abrupt onset
  * Renal artery stenosis, primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma

TREATMENT:
- Lifestyle: Weight loss (5-10% body weight, lowers BP 5-10 mmHg), DASH diet (low sodium, high K+, fruits/veggies)
- Exercise: 150 min/week moderate aerobic (walking, cycling)
- Limit alcohol: ≤2 drinks/day men, ≤1 women
- Medications:
  * First-line: ACE inhibitor (lisinopril 10-40 mg), ARB (losartan 50-100 mg), CCB (amlodipine 5-10 mg), thiazide diuretic (HCTZ 12.5-25 mg)
  * Goal: <130/80 mmHg (general), <140/90 (elderly, lower if tolerated)

---

TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM):

DIAGNOSIS:
- Fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL (×2 occasions)
- OR A1C ≥6.5%
- OR random glucose ≥200 mg/dL + symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss)
- OR 2-hour OGTT ≥200 mg/dL

EVALUATION:
- Labs: A1C, fasting glucose, lipid panel, Cr (renal function), urinalysis (proteinuria, microalbuminuria)
- Dilated eye exam (retinopathy, annually)
- Foot exam (neuropathy, ulcers, pulses)

TREATMENT:
- Lifestyle: Weight loss (7-10% body weight improves glycemic control), low-carb or Mediterranean diet
- Exercise: 150 min/week moderate + resistance training 2×/week
- Medications:
  * Metformin: First-line (500-1000 mg BID, start low to avoid GI upset)
    - Contraindications: GFR <30, lactic acidosis risk
  * GLP-1 agonist: Semaglutide (Ozempic 0.5-1 mg weekly SC), liraglutide
    - Benefits: Weight loss, CV protection, A1C reduction 1-1.5%
  * SGLT2 inhibitor: Empagliflozin (Jardiance 10-25 mg), canagliflozin
    - Benefits: Weight loss, CV protection, renal protection
    - Side effects: Genital yeast infections, DKA risk (rare)
  * Sulfonylureas: Glipizide, glyburide (cheap, but hypoglycemia, weight gain)
  * Insulin: If A1C >10%, symptomatic (start basal insulin, e.g., glargine 10 units QHS, titrate)
- GOAL: A1C <7% (general), <8% (elderly, comorbidities, individualize)

HYPERLIPIDEMIA:

DIAGNOSIS:
- Fasting lipid panel: Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides
- High LDL: >160 mg/dL (no risk factors), >130 (risk factors), >100 (diabetes/CHD)

RISK STRATIFICATION:
- ASCVD Risk Calculator (10-year risk of heart attack, stroke)
  * <5%: Low risk
  * 5-7.5%: Borderline
  * 7.5-20%: Intermediate
  * >20%: High risk

TREATMENT:
- Lifestyle: Low saturated fat (<7% calories), increase fiber (oats, beans), exercise
- Statins (first-line, reduce LDL, reduce CV events):
  * High-intensity: Atorvastatin 40-80 mg, rosuvastatin 20-40 mg (lower LDL 50%+)
  * Moderate-intensity: Atorvastatin 10-20 mg, simvastatin 20-40 mg (lower LDL 30-50%)
  * Side effects: Myalgias (muscle pain, 5-10%, try different statin), rhabdomyolysis (rare, severe muscle breakdown)
- Ezetimibe: Add if LDL not at goal on statin (blocks cholesterol absorption, additional 15-20% reduction)
- PCSK9 inhibitors: Expensive ($500-600/month), for very high risk or statin-intolerant (evolocumab, alirocumab)

DEPRESSION (Major Depressive Disorder):

SCREENING:
- PHQ-9 (9-question scale, score 0-27)
  * 5-9: Mild
  * 10-14: Moderate
  * 15-19: Moderately severe
  * 20-27: Severe

DIAGNOSIS (DSM-5):
- ≥5 symptoms for ≥2 weeks, including depressed mood OR loss of interest:
  * Depressed mood most of day
  * Loss of interest/pleasure (anhedonia)
  * Weight loss/gain, appetite change
  * Insomnia or hypersomnia
  * Psychomotor agitation or retardation
  * Fatigue, loss of energy
  * Worthlessness, excessive guilt
  * Difficulty concentrating
  * Recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation

TREATMENT:
- Psychotherapy: CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy), IPT (interpersonal therapy), first-line for mild-moderate
- Medications (moderate-severe):
  * SSRIs (first-line): Sertraline 50-200 mg, escitalopram 10-20 mg, fluoxetine 20-80 mg
    - Side effects: Nausea, sexual dysfunction (30-50%), weight gain, initial anxiety (reassure, transient)
    - Onset: 4-6 weeks (educate patient, don't stop early)
  * SNRIs: Venlafaxine, duloxetine (if pain comorbidity, fibromyalgia, neuropathy)
  * Bupropion: If sexual dysfunction concern, or weight gain (also helps smoking cessation)
  * Mirtazapine: If insomnia, weight loss (sedating, increases appetite)
- Safety: Screen for suicidal ideation (SI) at every visit
  * "Are you having thoughts of hurting yourself?"
  * If yes: Plan? Access to means? Hospitalize if imminent risk

CHRONIC DISEASE MEDICATIONS:

ASTHMA:
- STEP 1 (Intermittent): Albuterol inhaler PRN (rescue, ≤2 uses/week)
- STEP 2 (Mild persistent): Low-dose ICS (inhaled corticosteroid, e.g., fluticasone 88 mcg BID)
- STEP 3 (Moderate persistent): Medium-dose ICS or low-dose ICS + LABA (long-acting beta agonist, e.g., fluticasone/salmeterol 250/50 BID)
- Exacerbation: Prednisone 40-60 mg × 5 days (short burst, taper not needed if <2 weeks)

COPD:
- GOLD 1-2 (Mild-Moderate): LABA or LAMA (long-acting muscarinic antagonist, e.g., tiotropium)
- GOLD 3-4 (Severe): LABA + LAMA + ICS (if exacerbations)
- Exacerbation: Prednisone 40 mg × 5 days, antibiotics (if purulent sputum), increase bronchodilator use

GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease):
- Lifestyle: Elevate head of bed, avoid late meals, trigger foods (caffeine, alcohol, spicy, fatty)
- PPI (proton pump inhibitor): Omeprazole 20 mg daily (or BID if severe), pantoprazole, esomeprazole
  * Take 30-60 min before breakfast (requires acid to activate)
  * Long-term risks: Osteoporosis, C. diff infection, low B12/Mg (monitor if >1 year)
- H2 blocker: Famotidine 20 mg BID (less effective than PPI, but safer long-term)

---

PAIN MANAGEMENT:

ACUTE PAIN (Post-op, injury):
- Non-opioid first: Acetaminophen 1000 mg Q6H (max 4g/day), ibuprofen 600 mg Q6H (max 2400 mg/day)
- Combine: Acetaminophen + ibuprofen (additive, better than either alone)
- Opioids (if severe, short-term only):
  * Hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg Q4-6H PRN (≤3 days supply for acute pain, opioid epidemic awareness)
  * Tramadol 50-100 mg Q6H (less potent, lower abuse risk, but still scheduled)

CHRONIC PAIN:
- Non-pharmacologic: PT, CBT, acupuncture, weight loss
- Medications:
  * Neuropathic pain (diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia):
    - Gabapentin 300-900 mg TID (start 300 mg QHS, titrate slowly to reduce dizziness)
    - Pregabalin 75-150 mg BID (similar to gabapentin, twice daily dosing)
    - Duloxetine 60 mg daily (SNRI, also treats depression)
  * Musculoskeletal pain:
    - NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, topical diclofenac gel for localized pain)
    - Muscle relaxants: Cyclobenzaprine 5-10 mg QHS (sedating, short-term only)
- AVOID long-term opioids (risk of dependence, overdose, CDC guidelines recommend non-opioid alternatives)

## Patient Education & Counseling

```markdown
MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING:

PRINCIPLES:
- Express empathy (understand patient's perspective, non-judgmental)
- Develop discrepancy (highlight gap between current behavior and goals)
- Roll with resistance (don't argue, explore ambivalence)
- Support self-efficacy (believe patient can change, empower)

EXAMPLE (Smoking cessation):
- NP: "How do you feel about your smoking?"
- Patient: "I know it's bad, but I'm stressed and it helps me relax."
- NP: "It sounds like smoking is important to you right now. What worries you about it?"
- Patient: "I cough a lot, and my kids keep asking me to quit."
- NP: "So on one hand, smoking helps with stress, but on the other, it's affecting your health and your family. Where do you see yourself in this?"
- Patient: "I guess I should quit, but I don't know if I can."
- NP: "What would it take for you to feel ready?"

SHARED DECISION MAKING:
- Present options (risks, benefits, alternatives)
- Elicit patient values, preferences
- Make collaborative decision (not paternalistic, "You should...")

EXAMPLE (Diabetes medication):
- NP: "Your A1C is 8.5%, so we need to add a medication. We have a few options:
  * Metformin is cheap and effective, but some people get stomach upset.
  * GLP-1 agonist helps with weight loss and protects your heart, but it's a weekly shot and expensive.
  * SGLT2 inhibitor also helps weight and kidneys, but increases yeast infections.
  What's most important to you? Cost, avoiding shots, or side effects?"
- Patient: "I don't mind shots if it helps me lose weight."
- NP: "Okay, let's try the GLP-1 agonist. I'll check if your insurance covers it."

---

ADHERENCE:
- Simplify regimen (once-daily better than multiple doses)
- Address barriers (cost, side effects, understanding)
- Use teach-back: "Can you explain to me how you'll take this medication?"
- Follow-up: "Let's check in 2 weeks to see how it's going."
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Thorough history > fancy tests** - Most diagnoses made from history (80%), physical exam adds (10%), labs confirm (10%)
2. **Antibiotic stewardship** - Most URIs are viral (no antibiotics needed, educate patients)
3. **Lifestyle first** - HTN, diabetes, hyperlipidemia (diet, exercise before escalating meds)
4. **Motivational interviewing** - Change patient-driven (not provider-driven, more effective)
5. **Safety net** - "Come back if symptoms worsen" (catch missed diagnoses, serious conditions)
