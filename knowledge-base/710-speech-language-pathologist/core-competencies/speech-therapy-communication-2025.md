LANGUAGE:
- Receptive (understanding):
  * Following directions
  * Vocabulary knowledge
  * Comprehension
- Expressive (speaking):
  * Sentence structure (grammar)

FLUENCY:
- Stuttering (repetitions, prolongations, blocks)
- Rate (too fast, too slow)

VOICE:
- Quality (hoarse, breathy, strained)
- Pitch (too high, too low)
- Loudness (too soft, too loud)

PRAGMATICS (Social language):
- Turn-taking in conversation
- Eye contact

---

STANDARDIZED TESTS:

ARTICULATION:
- Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation-3 (GFTA-3)
- Ages: 2-21 years
- Single-word production (name pictures)
- Score: Standard score, percentile

LANGUAGE:
- CELF-5 (Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals)
- Ages: 5-21 years

- Ages: Birth-7 years
- Play-based assessment
- Receptive & Expressive scores

FLUENCY:
- SSI-4 (Stuttering Severity Instrument)
- Frequency (how often?)
- Duration (how long?)
- Physical concomitants (eye blinks, head jerks)
- Score: Very mild to Very severe

---

INFORMAL ASSESSMENT:

LANGUAGE SAMPLE:
- Record 15-20 min conversation or play
- Transcribe (write down exactly what child says)
- Analyze:
  * MLU (Mean Length of Utterance): Average words per sentence
    - 18 months: 1.0-2.0 words
    - 2 years: 2.0-2.5 words
    - 3 years: 3.0-3.5 words
    - 4 years: 4.0-4.5 words
    - 5 years: 5.0+ words
  * Grammar errors (verb tense, plurals, pronouns)
  * Vocabulary diversity (number of different words)

ORAL-MOTOR EXAM:
- Structure (lips, tongue, teeth, palate)
- Function (can they pucker, stick out tongue, blow?)
- Strength (tongue push against depressor)
- Coordination (rapid alternating movements: "puh-tuh-kuh")
```

## Articulation Therapy

```markdown
DEVELOPMENTAL NORMS:

AGE OF MASTERY (90% of children produce correctly):
- 3 years: /p, b, m, w, h/
- 4 years: /t, d, k, g, f, y/
- 5 years: /l/
- 6 years: /r, s, z, sh, ch, j/
- 7 years: /v, th (thin), th (this)/
- 8 years: /zh/ (measure)

RED FLAG: Not producing sounds by expected age + 1 year

---

TREATMENT APPROACH:

TRADITIONAL APPROACH:

STAGE 1: ISOLATION
- Produce sound alone: "Say /s/"
- Visual cues (mirror, watch my mouth)
- Tactile cues (tongue up, teeth together)
- Analogy ("snake sound")

STAGE 2: SYLLABLES
- /s/ in CV (consonant-vowel): "sah, see, soo"
- /s/ in VC (vowel-consonant): "as, iss, uss"
- /s/ in CVC: "sip, sit, bus"

STAGE 3: WORDS
- Initial position: "sun, sock, see"
- Medial position: "basket, listen, fancy"
- Final position: "bus, pass, yes"
- 80% accuracy before advancing

STAGE 4: SENTENCES
- Carrier phrase: "I see a sun"
- Questions: "Where is the sun?"
- Spontaneous sentences

STAGE 5: CONVERSATION
- Structured (answer questions about pictures)
- Unstructured (free conversation)
- 80% accuracy = ready for discharge

STAGE 6: GENERALIZATION
- Use in all settings (home, school, community)
- Self-monitoring (did I say it right?)

---

PHONOLOGICAL APPROACH (patterns):

PROCESSES (error patterns):

FINAL CONSONANT DELETION:
- Error: "ca" for "cat", "bu" for "bus"
- Target: Teach final consonants
- Activities: Add sounds to words ("ca" → "cat")

FRONTING:
- Error: "tar" for "car", "tea" for "key"
- Target: Produce back sounds /k, g/
- Activities: Contrast /t/ vs /k/ ("tea" vs "key")

STOPPING:
- Error: "top" for "shop", "doo" for "zoo"
- Target: Produce fricatives /f, s, sh, z/
- Activities: Continuous sounds (hold /s/ for 5 sec)

CLUSTER REDUCTION:
- Error: "poon" for "spoon", "tuck" for "truck"
- Target: Produce blends /sp, tr, bl, etc./
- Activities: Slow motion ("s...p...oon" → "spoon")

---

MINIMAL PAIRS:

CONCEPT: Contrast two sounds that change meaning

EXAMPLE (/k/ vs /t/):
- "coat" vs "tote"
- "cave" vs "tape"
- "back" vs "bat"

ACTIVITY:
1. Therapist says "coat"
2. Child points to picture of coat (vs tote)
3. Child says "coat" (clear production)
4. If child says "tote", point to wrong picture (show impact of error)

GOAL: Realize production error changes meaning

## Language Therapy

```markdown
RECEPTIVE LANGUAGE:

FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS:
- 1-step (18 months): "Give me the ball"
- 2-step (2 years): "Get the book and put it on the table"
- 3-step (3 years): "Pick up the crayon, put it in the box, then sit down"
- Temporal (4+ years): "Before you touch the cat, clap your hands"

ACTIVITIES:
- Simon Says
- Barrier games (listener can't see, must follow directions to build)
- Cooking (follow recipe steps)

VOCABULARY:
- Nouns (objects): "Show me the shoe"
- Verbs (actions): "Point to eating"
- Adjectives (descriptors): "Find the big one"
- Concepts: Colors, shapes, sizes, positions (in/on/under)

ACTIVITIES:
- Sort pictures (animals vs vehicles)
- Same vs different (compare two pictures)
- Categories (which one doesn't belong?)

---

EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE:

GRAMMAR (Morphology):

BROWN'S STAGES (typical development):

STAGE 1 (12-26 months, MLU 1.0-2.0):
- Present progressive "-ing" (eating, running)
- Plural "-s" (cats, dogs)
- Prepositions "in", "on"

STAGE 2 (27-30 months, MLU 2.0-2.5):
- Past tense "-ed" (walked, jumped)
- Possessive "'s" (mommy's)
- Uncontractible copula "is/are" (Where is it?)

STAGE 3 (31-34 months, MLU 2.5-3.0):
- Articles "a", "the" (a cat, the dog)
- Contractible copula "is/are" (He's big)

STAGE 4 (35-40 months, MLU 3.0-3.75):
- Past irregular (went, ran, ate)
- Third person singular "-s" (he walks, she runs)

STAGE 5 (41+ months, MLU 3.75-4.5):
- Contractible auxiliary "is/are" (He's running)
- Uncontractible auxiliary (Where is he going?)

TARGET: If child missing Stage 2, teach those first (don't skip ahead)

---

ACTIVITIES:

PLAY-BASED (young children):
- Feed animals: "The cow is eating. The pig is eating."
- Drive cars: "The car goes fast. The truck goes slow."
- Repetition: Child hears target 20+ times per session

STRUCTURED (school-age):
- Sentence completion: "Yesterday I walk to school" → "walked"
- Fill-in-blank: "She ____ to the store" (goes)
- Story retell: Listen to story, retell with target grammar

---

NARRATIVE SKILLS:

STAGES:

HEAP (2-3 years):
- Labels pictures, no sequence
- "Dog. Cat. Tree."

SEQUENCE (3-4 years):
- Lists events, no plot
- "He went to the store. Then he ate. Then he played."

PRIMITIVE NARRATIVE (4-5 years):
- Beginning, middle, end
- "A boy got a dog. They played. He was happy."

CHAIN (5-6 years):
- Causation (because, so)
- "The boy found a dog. He was lonely so he kept it."

TRUE NARRATIVE (6+ years):
- Character motivation, problem, solution
- "Once there was a lonely boy. One day he found a lost dog. He decided to keep it because he wanted a friend. They became best friends."

ACTIVITIES:
- Story grammar cues: Who? Where? What happened? How did they feel? How did it end?
- Retell familiar stories (Goldilocks, Three Little Pigs)
- Create stories from pictures (wordless books)
```

## Fluency (Stuttering) Therapy

```markdown
TYPES OF DISFLUENCIES:

TYPICAL (everyone does):
- Interjections ("um", "uh", "like")
- Revisions ("I want—I need a cookie")
- Phrase repetitions ("I want-I want a cookie")
- <2% of words (within normal limits)

STUTTERED (concern):
- Sound repetitions ("b-b-b-ball")
- Syllable repetitions ("ba-ba-ball")
- Prolongations ("sssun")
- Blocks (silent pause, tension)
- >3% of words = stutter

SECONDARY BEHAVIORS:
- Eye blinks
- Head jerks
- Fist clenching
- Avoidance (using different word to avoid stuttering)

---

TREATMENT APPROACHES:

INDIRECT (preschool):
- Parent training (slow your rate, pause, no pressure)
- Reduce time pressure (don't rush child)
- Acknowledge feelings ("I see you're frustrated")
- Model fluent speech

DIRECT (school-age):

FLUENCY SHAPING:
- Teach fluent speech:
  * Easy onset (soft start of word)
  * Light contacts (don't press lips/tongue hard)
  * Continuous voicing (smooth, no breaks)
- Practice: Slow, exaggerated → Faster → Natural rate

STUTTERING MODIFICATION:
- Accept stuttering (it's ok to stutter)
- Reduce tension (stutter easier)
- Cancellations (stop, restart smoothly)
- Pull-outs (during stutter, reduce tension, finish smoothly)

COGNITIVE (teens/adults):
- Desensitization (reduce fear of stuttering)
- Voluntary stuttering (stutter on purpose to reduce anxiety)
- Self-disclosure ("I stutter. It's ok.")
- Support groups (connect with others who stutter)

PROGNOSIS:
- 75% of preschoolers recover naturally
- Earlier intervention = better outcomes
- Family history of stuttering = lower recovery rate

## Voice Therapy

```markdown
VOICE DISORDERS:

VOCAL NODULES:
- Benign growths on vocal cords (calluses)
- Cause: Voice abuse (yelling, screaming, singing)
- Symptoms: Hoarse, breathy voice
- Treatment:
  * Voice rest (reduce talking)
  * Hydration (8 glasses water/day)
  * Vocal hygiene (no yelling, clearing throat)
  * Therapy: Easy onset, reduce loudness
  * Surgery if severe (rare in children)

VOCAL CORD PARALYSIS:
- One or both cords don't move
- Cause: Injury (surgery, trauma, tumor)
- Symptoms: Weak, breathy voice
- Treatment:
  * Pushing exercises (increase adduction)
  * Loudness training
  * Surgery (medialization, injection)

MUSCLE TENSION DYSPHONIA:
- Excessive tension in throat
- Cause: Stress, compensating for weakness
- Symptoms: Strained, effortful voice
- Treatment:
  * Relaxation (neck, shoulder massage)
  * Yawn-sigh (relaxed phonation)
  * Confidential voice (quiet, breathy)

---

VOCAL HYGIENE:

DO:
- Drink water (8 glasses/day)
- Humidifier (dry air irritates cords)
- Warm up voice (hum, gentle sounds before heavy use)
- Use amplification (microphone if teacher/performer)

DON'T:
- Yell, scream
- Smoke (primary cause of voice problems)
- Clear throat (use swallow instead)
- Whisper (more strain than quiet voice)
- Caffeine, alcohol (dehydrating)
```

## AAC (Augmentative & Alternative Communication)

```markdown
WHO NEEDS AAC:

TEMPORARY:
- Intubated (tube in throat)
- Laryngectomy (vocal cord removal)
- Severe aphasia (stroke)

PERMANENT:
- Cerebral palsy (motor impairment)
- ALS (progressive loss of speech)
- Autism (minimally verbal)

MYTH: "AAC prevents speech development"
FACT: AAC facilitates language (gives means to communicate)

---

LOW-TECH:

COMMUNICATION BOARDS:
- Pictures/words on board
- Point to desired item
- Example: "I want" + pictures of food, drink, toy
- Cheap, portable, easy

PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System):
- Teach child to exchange picture for item
- Phase 1: Give picture, get item
- Phase 2: Distance (walk to adult)
- Phase 3: Discrimination (choose from multiple pictures)
- Phase 4: Sentence structure ("I want" + item)

---

MID-TECH:

VOICE OUTPUT DEVICES:
- Button records message (10-60 sec)
- Press button, plays message
- Example: "Can I have a break?"
- BIGmack, Step-by-Step
- $50-$200

---

HIGH-TECH:

SPEECH-GENERATING DEVICES (SGD):
- Tablet with AAC app
- Select picture/word, device speaks
- Apps:
  * Proloquo2Go ($250, robust vocabulary)
  * LAMP Words for Life ($300, motor planning focus)
  * TouchChat ($150, customizable)
- Funding: Insurance often covers (medical necessity)

ACCESS METHODS:
- Direct select (touch screen)
- Switch (button, head switch for motor impairment)
- Eye gaze (track eyes, select with stare)

VOCABULARY ORGANIZATION:
- Core vocabulary (high-frequency words: I, want, go, more)
- Fringe vocabulary (specific: pizza, doctor, grandma)
- Start small (20-30 words), expand gradually
```
