## Chiropractic Examination

```markdown
HISTORY:

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
- "What brings you in today?"
- Location (where hurts?)
- Onset (when start? sudden or gradual?)
- Duration (how long?)
- Intensity (0-10 scale)
- Aggravating factors (worse with sitting, bending, lifting?)
- Relieving factors (better with rest, ice, heat?)

RED FLAGS:
🚩 Trauma (fall, car accident → possible fracture)
🚩 Age <20 or >50 (cancer more common)
🚩 Fever, night sweats (infection)
🚩 Weight loss (cancer)
🚩 Bowel/bladder dysfunction (cauda equina → emergency!)
🚩 Progressive neurological deficit (weakness worsening)

If present → Refer to MD, imaging (X-ray, MRI)

PHYSICAL EXAM:

POSTURE:
- Front view: Level shoulders, level hips
- Side view: Ear over shoulder over hip
- Scoliosis: Spine curves sideways (S or C shape)

RANGE OF MOTION (ROM):
CERVICAL (Neck):
- Flexion (chin to chest): 45-50°
- Extension (look up): 45-50°

- Lateral flexion: 20-30°

ORTHOPEDIC TESTS:

STRAIGHT LEG RAISE (SLR):
- Patient supine (on back)
- Lift leg straight up
- Positive: Pain radiates down leg <70° (disc herniation)

KEMP'S TEST (Low back):

## Spinal Adjustment Techniques

```markdown
HIGH-VELOCITY LOW-AMPLITUDE (HVLA):

DIVERSIFIED TECHNIQUE:
- Most common
- Quick thrust (audible "pop" or "crack")
- Specific joint

EXAMPLE (Lumbar side posture):
1. Patient side-lying
2. Bottom leg straight, top leg flexed
3. Rotate torso (opposite direction of legs)
4. Contact transverse process with pisiform
5. Quick thrust (P→A, posterior to anterior)
6. "Pop" = gas release from joint (cavitation)

NOT PAINFUL (if done correctly):
- Pressure, then release
- If hurts, stop (wrong technique or contraindication)

---

LOW-FORCE TECHNIQUES:

ACTIVATOR:
- Handheld spring-loaded instrument
- Small, controlled impulse
- No "cracking"
- Good for: Elderly, osteoporosis, patient preference

SACRO-OCCIPITAL TECHNIQUE (SOT):
- Wedge blocks under pelvis
- Patient's body weight creates gentle adjustment
- Gravity-assisted
- Very gentle

DROP TABLE:
- Table with sections that drop slightly
- Momentum assists adjustment
- Less force needed

---

MOBILIZATION:

- Slow, repetitive movements
- No thrust, no "pop"
- Stretch joint, increase ROM
- Example: Cervical lateral flexion (gently pull head to side)

SOFT TISSUE:
- Massage (myofascial release)
- Trigger point therapy (pressure on knots)
- Instrument-assisted (Graston, scraping tool)
- Active Release Technique (ART): Move limb while applying pressure
```

## Common Conditions

```markdown
LOW BACK PAIN:

MECHANICAL (Non-specific):
- 85% of low back pain
- Muscle strain, ligament sprain
- Precipitating factor (lifted heavy, awkward position)
- No nerve involvement

TREATMENT:
- Spinal adjustment (restore motion)
- Soft tissue therapy (relax muscles)
- Ice (first 48 hours, reduce inflammation)
- Heat (after 48 hours, relax muscles)
- Exercise (core strengthening, avoid bed rest!)
- Expected: 50% better in 1 week, 90% in 6 weeks

---

DISC HERNIATION:

- Disc bulge → presses nerve → radiating pain
- Sciatica: Pain down back of leg (L5 or S1 nerve)
- Symptoms: Leg pain > back pain, numbness, tingling, weakness

TREATMENT:
- Flexion-distraction (Cox technique): Gentle stretch, decompress disc
- Avoid extension exercises (pushes disc further out)
- Nerve flossing (gentle nerve glides)
- 80% improve with conservative care (avoid surgery)
- Refer if: Progressive weakness, cauda equina

SURGERY (if needed):
- Microdiscectomy (remove disc fragment)
- Success rate: 80-90%
- Last resort (try 6-12 weeks conservative first)

---

NECK PAIN:

MECHANICAL (Facet joint):
- Stiff, ache
- Worse with extension, rotation
- Treatment: Adjustment, mobilization, posture correction

WHIPLASH (Car accident):
- Hyperextension → hyperflexion
- Symptoms: Neck pain, headache, dizziness
- Treatment: Early mobilization (don't immobilize!), exercise
- Prognosis: 50% full recovery, 50% chronic pain

TEXT NECK (Tech neck):
- Forward head posture (looking down at phone)
- Headaches, upper back pain
- Treatment: Posture correction, chin tucks, strengthen neck flexors
- Prevention: Hold phone at eye level, take breaks

---

HEADACHES:

CERVICOGENIC (Neck-origin):
- Start in neck → spread to head
- One-sided
- Worse with neck movement, pressure on neck muscles
- Treatment: Cervical adjustment, upper back mobilization
- Success rate: 70-80%

TENSION HEADACHE:
- Band-like pressure
- Bilateral (both sides)
- Stress, poor posture
- Treatment: Adjustment, soft tissue therapy, stress management

MIGRAINE:
- Severe, throbbing, one-sided
- Nausea, light sensitivity
- Chiropractic helps some (reduce frequency/intensity)
- Refer if: Frequent (>4/month), severe

- Gentle stretches (pain-free range)

---

SUBACUTE PHASE (2-6 weeks):

GOALS:
- Restore ROM
- Begin strengthening

EXERCISES:

CAT-CAMEL (Lumbar mobility):
- Hands and knees
- Arch back (cat), then sag (camel)
- 10 reps, 2-3× daily

---

ERGONOMICS:

DESK SETUP:
- Monitor at eye level (not looking down)
- Elbows 90°, wrists neutral
- Feet flat on floor
- Lumbar support (chair or cushion)
- Take breaks (stand every 30 min, walk every hour)

LIFTING:
- Bend knees, not back
- Keep load close to body
- No twisting while lifting
- Ask for help if heavy

SLEEPING:
- Side-lying: Pillow between knees
