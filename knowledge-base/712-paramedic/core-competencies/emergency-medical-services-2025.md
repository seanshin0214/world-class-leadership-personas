## Scene Assessment & Safety

```markdown
SCENE SIZE-UP:

BSI (Body Substance Isolation):
- Gloves (minimum, always)
- Mask (if respiratory symptoms, COVID)
- Eye protection (blood, fluids)
- Gown (major trauma, childbirth)

SCENE SAFETY:
- Violence? (domestic, assault → wait for police)
- Hazmat? (chemicals, gas → specialized team)
- Traffic? (highway accident → cones, flares, reflective vest)
- Unstable structure? (building collapse → don't enter)

NUMBER OF PATIENTS:
- One patient → standard approach
- Multiple (MCI, Mass Casualty Incident) → triage, call for resources

MECHANISM OF INJURY (MOI):
- High-speed crash → suspect spinal injury
- Fall >20 feet → major trauma
- Gunshot/stab → penetrating trauma

NATURE OF ILLNESS:
- Chest pain → cardiac
- Shortness of breath → respiratory
- Altered mental status → stroke, hypoglycemia, overdose
```

## Primary Assessment (ABCs)

```markdown
A - AIRWAY:

OPEN?
- Conscious, talking → airway open
- Unconscious → head-tilt chin-lift (or jaw-thrust if trauma)

OBSTRUCTED?
- Snoring → tongue blocking (position airway)
- Gurgling → fluids (suction)
- Stridor → partial obstruction (foreign body, swelling)

INTERVENTIONS:
- OPA (Oral Pharyngeal Airway): Unconscious patients
- NPA (Nasal Pharyngeal Airway): Semi-conscious (gag reflex intact)
- Suction (Yankauer tip for oropharynx)
- Intubation (advanced airway, paramedic-level)

---

B - BREATHING:

RATE:
- Normal: 12-20 breaths/min (adult)
- <10 → Hypoventilation (assist with BVM)
- >30 → Hyperventilation (anxiety, pain, hypoxia)

QUALITY:
- Shallow vs Deep
- Labored (accessory muscles, tripod position)
- Unequal breath sounds (pneumothorax, hemothorax)

SPO2 (Pulse Oximetry):
- >95% → Normal
- 90-94% → Mild hypoxia (supplemental O2)
- <90% → Severe hypoxia (high-flow O2, assist ventilation)

INTERVENTIONS:
- Nasal cannula: 1-6 L/min (24-44% O2)
- Non-rebreather mask: 10-15 L/min (60-90% O2)
- BVM (Bag-Valve-Mask): Assist or control ventilation
- Chest decompression (needle for tension pneumothorax, advanced)

---

C - CIRCULATION:

PULSE:
- Rate: 60-100 bpm (adult)
- <60 → Bradycardia (heart block, medications)
- >100 → Tachycardia (shock, pain, anxiety, arrhythmia)

QUALITY:
- Strong vs Weak
- Regular vs Irregular

BLOOD PRESSURE:
- Normal: 120/80 mmHg
- Hypertensive: >140/90 (stroke risk)
- Hypotensive: <90 systolic (shock)

BLEEDING:
- Direct pressure (first-line)
- Pressure dressing
- Tourniquet (uncontrolled extremity bleeding, last resort)
  * Apply high on limb
  * Note time applied (ischemic damage after 2 hours)

SHOCK:
- Compensated: Normal BP, ↑ HR, pale, anxious
- Decompensated: ↓ BP, ↑ HR, altered mental status
- Treatment: Oxygen, IV fluids, Trendelenburg (legs up), rapid transport

---

D - DISABILITY (Neurological):

AVPU:
- A: Alert (oriented to person, place, time, event)
- V: Verbal (responds to voice)
- P: Pain (responds only to painful stimulus)
- U: Unresponsive

GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale):
- Eye opening (1-4)
- Verbal response (1-5)
- Motor response (1-6)
- Total: 3-15 (3 = coma, 15 = fully awake)
- <8 = Severe (intubate)

PUPILS:
- PERRLA: Pupils Equal, Round, Reactive to Light, Accommodating
- Unequal pupils → brain injury, stroke
- Pinpoint → opioid overdose
- Dilated → stimulant, hypoxia

BLOOD GLUCOSE:
- Normal: 70-100 mg/dL
- <60 → Hypoglycemia (give glucose, D50)
- >250 → Hyperglycemia (DKA risk)

---

E - EXPOSE:
- Remove clothing (assess for hidden injuries)
- Maintain modesty (cover with sheet)
- Prevent hypothermia (blankets, warm ambulance)
```

## Cardiac Emergencies

```markdown
CHEST PAIN (Possible MI):

OPQRST:
- O: Onset (sudden or gradual? activity or rest?)
- P: Provocation (what makes it better/worse?)
- Q: Quality (crushing, sharp, burning?)
- R: Radiation (jaw, left arm, back?)
- S: Severity (0-10 scale?)
- T: Time (how long? when start?)

SIGNS OF MI (Heart attack):
- Substernal chest pain (pressure, squeezing)
- Radiates to left arm, jaw, back
- Diaphoresis (sweating)
- Nausea, vomiting
- Shortness of breath
- Sense of impending doom

TREATMENT:
1. Oxygen (if SpO2 <94%)
2. Aspirin 324 mg (chew, not swallow - antiplatelet)
3. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL (if systolic BP >100, not taken Viagra/Cialis)
   - Repeat q 5 min × 3 if needed
   - Side effect: Headache, hypotension
4. 12-lead ECG (ST elevation → STEMI → cath lab)
5. IV access
6. Transport (lights & sirens, STEMI alert to hospital)

---

CARDIAC ARREST:

RECOGNITION:

- Rate: 100-120/min ("Stayin' Alive" tempo)
- Depth: 2-2.4 inches (adult)
- Allow full recoil
- Minimize interruptions (<10 sec)

AED (Automated External Defibrillator):
- Turn on, follow prompts
- Shockable rhythms: V-Fib, Pulseless V-Tach
- Non-shockable: Asystole, PEA (pulseless electrical activity)
- If shockable: Clear patient, deliver shock, resume CPR immediately
- Reanalyze every 2 min

ADVANCED CARDIAC LIFE SUPPORT (ACLS):

MEDICATIONS:
- Epinephrine 1 mg IV (every 3-5 min)
  * Vasoconstrictor (increases coronary perfusion)
- Amiodarone 300 mg IV (if V-Fib/V-Tach persists)
  * Antiarrhythmic

ADVANCED AIRWAY:
- Intubation (secure airway, 100% O2)
- Continuous compressions (no pauses for breaths)
- Capnography (ETCO2, confirm tube placement, monitor CPR quality)

REVERSIBLE CAUSES (H's & T's):
- Hypovolemia (IV fluids)
- Hypoxia (O2, ventilation)
- H+ (acidosis → hyperventilate)
- Hypo/hyperkalemia (ECG changes → treat electrolytes)
- Hypothermia (rewarm)
- Tension pneumothorax (needle decompression)
- Tamponade (cardiac, pericardiocentesis)
- Thrombosis (MI → PCI, PE → thrombolytics)
- Toxins (overdose → naloxone, antidotes)

TERMINATION OF RESUSCITATION:
- >20 min CPR, no ROSC (Return of Spontaneous Circulation)
- Asystole throughout
- No reversible causes
- Consult medical direction

## Key Takeaways

1. **Scene safety first** - Dead paramedic helps no one
2. **ABCs** - Airway, Breathing, Circulation (life threats first)
3. **Time-critical** - Trauma, stroke, MI (load & go)
4. **Reassess** - Patients change (monitor, re-check vitals every 5-15 min)
5. **Documentation** - If not documented, didn't happen (legal protection)
