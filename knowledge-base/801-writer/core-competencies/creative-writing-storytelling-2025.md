## Character Development

### Creating Compelling Characters

```

## Show, Don't Tell

```markdown
TELLING (Weak):
"Sarah was angry."

SHOWING (Strong):
"Sarah's jaw clenched. She slammed the door so hard the frame splintered."

---

TELLING:
"The house was old and creepy."

SHOWING:
"The floorboards groaned with each step. Cobwebs draped the corners like tattered curtains, and the air smelled of must and rot."

---

TELLING:
"John was in love with Mary."

SHOWING:
"John's heart raced whenever Mary entered the room. He memorized the way she tucked her hair behind her left ear, always the left."

---

SENSORY DETAILS (Engage 5 senses):
✅ Sight: Vivid imagery
✅ Sound: "The clock ticked, a metronome of anxiety"
✅ Smell: "The bakery smelled of cinnamon and possibility"
✅ Taste: "The coffee was bitter, like regret"
✅ Touch: "The fabric was rough, like sandpaper"

AVOID FILTER WORDS:
❌ "She felt sad" → ✅ "Tears blurred her vision"
❌ "He saw the car" → ✅ "The red Ferrari gleamed"
❌ "She heard a noise" → ✅ "A floorboard creaked"
```

---

## Dialogue

### Writing Natural Dialogue

```markdown
GOOD DIALOGUE:

"We need to talk."
"About what?"
"You know what." Sarah crossed her arms.
"I don't have time for this." He turned to leave.
"Make time."

WHY IT WORKS:
- Short sentences (how people actually speak)
- Subtext (tension beneath surface)
- Action beats (crossed arms, turned to leave)
- No filler words

---

BAD DIALOGUE:

"Hello, John. How are you doing today?"
"I am doing well, thank you for asking, Sarah."
"That's great to hear. I wanted to talk to you about something important."

WHY IT FAILS:
- Too formal (no one talks like this)
- No subtext or conflict
- Boring filler

---

DIALOGUE TAGS:

SIMPLE IS BEST:
✅ "said" (invisible - use 90% of the time)
✅ "asked"
❌ "exclaimed" "gasped" "hissed" (overused, distracting)

VARY WITH ACTION BEATS:
"I can't believe you did that." She threw the vase across the room.
"Wait, let me explain—"
"Explain?" Her voice cracked. "You had six months to explain."

ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY TAGS:
Two-person scene = every other line doesn't need a tag

"Where were you last night?"
"Work."
"Until 2 AM?"
"Big project."
"You're lying."
(No tags needed - clear who's speaking)

---

SUBTEXT (What's not said):

SURFACE:
"How was your day?"
"Fine."

SUBTEXT (They just had huge fight):
"How was your day?" She didn't look up from her phone.
"Fine." He slammed his keys on the counter.

→ Readers feel tension without explicit statement
```

---

## Pacing

```markdown
FAST PACING (Action, tension):
- Short sentences
- Short paragraphs
- Active verbs
- Present tense (optional)

Example:
"Run!
The footsteps grew louder. Closer.
She didn't look back.
Her lungs burned. Legs screamed.
Almost there. Almost—"

SLOW PACING (Reflection, description):
- Longer sentences
- Descriptive language
- Internal monologue

Example:
"She sat by the window, watching the rain trace rivulets down the glass. Each drop was a memory—her father's laugh, her mother's songs, the house that no longer existed. Time moved like honey here, thick and sweet with melancholy."

---

VARY PACING:
- Fast → slow → fast (like a roller coaster)
- Don't maintain same pace throughout (exhausting or boring)
- Action scene → character reflection → action
```

---

## Conflict

```markdown
TYPES OF CONFLICT:

EXTERNAL (Character vs. External force):
1. Character vs. Character (Protagonist vs. Antagonist)
2. Character vs. Nature (Survival story, natural disaster)
3. Character vs. Society (Dystopia, rebellion)
4. Character vs. Technology (AI takeover, sci-fi)

INTERNAL (Character vs. Self):
5. Character vs. Themselves (Internal struggle, addiction, fear)

BEST STORIES = BOTH:
- External: Katniss fights Capitol (Hunger Games)
- Internal: Katniss struggles with trauma, PTSD

---

CONFLICT IN EVERY SCENE:
If scene has no conflict → Cut it or add conflict

TYPES OF SCENE CONFLICT:
- Argument
- Obstacle (physical or emotional)
- Moral dilemma
- Revelation
- Betrayal
- Setback

BORING SCENE:
"They went to dinner. They talked. They went home."

SCENE WITH CONFLICT:
"They went to dinner to celebrate their anniversary. He forgot. She noticed. The silence over dessert was louder than any argument."
```

---

## Revision Process

```markdown
FIRST DRAFT:
- Goal: Get words on page
- Don't edit as you write (kills momentum)
- "Write drunk, edit sober" (Hemingway)
- Aim for 1,000-2,000 words/day
- Finish draft before revising (3-6 months for novel)

REVISION (Multiple passes):

PASS 1: STRUCTURE (Big picture)
- Does plot make sense?
- Does character arc track?
- Any plot holes?
- Pacing issues?
- Cut unnecessary scenes

PASS 2: CHARACTER
- Is protagonist compelling?
- Are motivations clear?
- Do characters sound distinct?
- Eliminate flat/stereotypical characters

PASS 3: SCENE-LEVEL
- Does every scene have conflict/purpose?
- Show vs. tell
- Sensory details
- Dialogue natural?

PASS 4: LINE-LEVEL (Prose)
- Eliminate clichés
- Vary sentence structure
- Cut adverbs ("very", "really", "ly" words)
- Active voice > passive voice
- Read aloud (catch awkward phrases)

PASS 5: POLISH
- Grammar, spelling, punctuation
- Consistency (character names, timelines)
- Format (industry standard: 12pt Times New Roman, double-spaced)

BETA READERS:
- 3-5 trusted readers (writers, avid readers)
- Ask specific questions:
  * Did you care about protagonist?
  * Were you confused anywhere?
  * Did pace drag?
  * What's your favorite/least favorite scene?
- Incorporate feedback (but not all - trust your instinct)

PROFESSIONAL EDITOR (Optional but recommended):
- Developmental edit: $0.01-0.05/word ($800-4,000 for 80K novel)
- Copy edit: $0.01-0.03/word
- Worth it if self-publishing or submitting to agents
```

## Publishing Paths

```markdown
TRADITIONAL PUBLISHING:

STEP 1: FIND AGENT
- Query letter (1-page pitch)
- Synopsis (1-2 pages)
- First 50 pages
- Research agents (QueryTracker, Publisher's Marketplace)
- Personalize each query

Success rate: 1-5% of queries get agent

STEP 2: AGENT SUBMITS TO PUBLISHERS
- Agent pitches to editors (Big 5: Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, etc.)
- Editor acquires book → Contract

Success rate: ~50% of agented books sell

STEP 3: PUBLICATION
- Advance: $5K-50K (debut authors, genre fiction) to $100K+ (established authors)
- Royalties: 10-15% of cover price (after earning out advance)
- Publisher handles: Editing, cover design, distribution, some marketing
- Timeline: 12-24 months (contract → publication)

PROS:
✅ Prestige
✅ Bookstore distribution
✅ Upfront advance
✅ Professional team (editor, designer)

CONS:
❌ Low acceptance rate
❌ Slow process
❌ Less creative control
❌ Lower royalties

---

SELF-PUBLISHING (Indie):

PLATFORMS:
- Amazon KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) - 70% royalty
- IngramSpark (print distribution)
- Draft2Digital (multi-platform ebook)

COSTS:
- Cover design: $500-2,000
- Editing: $1,000-5,000
- Formatting: $200-500 (or DIY with Vellum)
- Marketing: $500-5,000/year
**Total upfront: $2,000-10,000**

MARKETING (YOU do this):
- Build email list (offer free book for sign-up)
- Amazon ads ($500-2,000/month)
- Social media (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter)
- Book launch team (ARC readers)
- Newsletter swaps with other authors

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Breakeven: Sell ~1,000 copies ($2.99 ebook × 70% = $2.09 profit × 1,000 = $2,090)
- Good: 5,000+ copies first year
- Great: 20,000+ copies

PROS:
✅ High royalties (70% vs 10%)
✅ Fast (publish in weeks)

---

HYBRID AUTHORS:

```

## Writing Routine

```markdown
DAILY WORD COUNT:
- Stephen King: 2,000 words/day (365 days/year)
- Neil Gaiman: "Write one word, then another"
- You: 500-1,000 words/day (sustainable)

80,000-word novel ÷ 1,000 words/day = 80 days (2.5 months draft)

---

OVERCOMING WRITER'S BLOCK:

STRATEGIES:
1. LOWER STANDARDS (Permission to write badly)
2. SKIP AHEAD (Stuck on scene? Jump to next one)
3. CHANGE LOCATION (Coffee shop, library, park)
4. SPRINT (Write 10 min without stopping, no editing)
5. READ (Input fuels output)
6. WALK (Ideas come when not forcing them)

WRITING PROMPTS:
- "Write a scene where character must choose between two impossible options"
- "Character discovers secret that changes everything"
- "Two characters who hate each other must work together"

---

PROTECT WRITING TIME:
- Schedule it (same time every day = habit)
- Turn off phone, internet (use Freedom, Cold Turkey apps)
- Tell family "I'm writing 6-8 AM, don't disturb unless emergency"
- Track progress (spreadsheet, Scrivener, NaNoWriMo)
```

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Finish first draft** - Many start, few finish → Completing separates you
2. **Revision = real writing** - First draft is clay, revision is sculpture
3. **Read widely** - Best writers are avid readers (learn by osmosis)
4. **Write daily** - Consistency > inspiration (inspiration comes while working)
5. **Publish** - Don't let perfect be enemy of good → Ship it!
